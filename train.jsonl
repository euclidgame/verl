Since $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, by the law of quadratic reciprocity we have\n$\\chi(-3) = +1$, so $\\chi(c/3) = \\chi(-c)$.\nIt thus remains to evaluate the product $\\prod_{c=1}^{p-1} c^{(p+\\chi(-c))/2}$ modulo $p$.\n\nIf $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, this is easy: each factor is a quadratic residue (this is clear if $c$ is a residue,\nand otherwise $\\chi(-c) = +1$ so $p+\\chi(-c)$ is divisible by $4$) and $-1$ is not, so we must get $+1$\nmodulo $p$.\n\nIf $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, we must do more work: we\nchoose a primitive root $g$ modulo $p$ and rewrite the product as\n\\[\n\\prod_{i=0}^{p-2} g^{i(p+(-1)^i)/2}.\n\\]\nThe sum of the exponents, split into sums over $i$ odd and $i$ even, gives\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{(p-3)/2} \\left( j(p+1) + \\frac{(2j+1)(p-1)}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to\n\\[\n\\frac{(p-3)(p-1)(p+1)}{8} + \\frac{(p-1)^3}{8} = \\frac{p-1}{2} \\left( \\frac{p^2 - 1}{2} - p \\right).\n\\]\nHence the product we are trying to evaluate is congruent to $g^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1$ modulo $p$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Third solution} (by Mark van Hoeij).\nWe compute the parity of $\\pi$ as the parity of the number of cycles of even length\nin the cycle decomposition of $\\pi$.\nFor $x$ a nonzero residue class modulo $p$ of multiplicative order $d$, the elements of the orbit of $x$\nunder $\\pi$ also have order $d$ (because $d$ divides $p-1$ and hence is coprime to $3$). Since the group\nof nonzero residue classes modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$, the elements of order $d$ fall into\n$\\varphi(d)/f(d)$ orbits under $\\pi$, where $\\varphi$ is the Euler phi function and $f(d)$ is the\nmultiplicative order of 3 modulo $d$. The parity of $\\pi$ is then the parity of the sum of $\\varphi(d)/f(d)$\nover all divisors $d$ of $p-1$ for which $f(d)$ is even.\n\nIf $d$ is odd, then $\\varphi(d)/f(d) = \\varphi(2d)/f(2d)$, so the summands corresponding to $d$ and $2d$\ncoincide. It thus suffices to consider those $d$ divisible by $4$. If $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then there are no\nsuch summands, so the sum is trivially even.\n\nIf $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $d=4$ contributes a summand of $\\varphi(4)/f(4) = 2/2 = 1$.\nFor each $d$ which is a larger multiple of 4, the group $(\\ZZ/d\\ZZ)^*$ is isomorphic to the product of\n$\\ZZ/2\\ZZ$ with another group of even order, so the maximal power of 2 dividing $f(d)$ is strictly smaller\nthan the maximal power of 2 dividing $d$. Hence $\\varphi(d)/f(d)$ is even, and so the overall sum is odd.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nNote that the second proof uses quadratic reciprocity, whereas the first and third proofs are similar to several classical\nproofs of quadratic reciprocity.

$\\ol{BZ} \\cap \\ol{CY}$, proving the claim.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  One could also proceed by using barycentric coordinates on $\\triangle DEF$.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{remark*}\n  [Eric Shen]\n  The first four bullets can be replaced by non-projective means:\n  one can check that $\\ol{BZ} \\cap \\ol{CY}$ is the radical center\n  of $(BIC)$, $(BB_1B_2)$, $(CC_1C_2)$ and therefore it lies on line $\\ol{XT}$.\n\\end{remark*}\n\nNow, we contend point $V$ is the radical center $(CC_1C_2)$, $(ABC)$ and $(DEF)$.\nTo see this, let $V' = \\ol{ED} \\cap \\ol{AB}$;\nthen $(FV';AB)$ is harmonic, and $V$

Note that the tiles can be further classified into two types:\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\ii \\textbf{First type}: These tiles have exactly four columns,\n    each with exactly three cells (an odd

and the tiles of the first type cover an odd number of red cells.\n  Hence the number of tiles of the first type must be even.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  This shows that a rectangle can be

180\\dg$.\n\\end{claim*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  The angles in the statement imply that $A$ and $C$\n  are isogonal conjugates with respect to $\\triangle PBC$.\n  Thus, lines $PA$ and $PC$ are isogonal with respect to $\\angle BPC$, as needed.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{asy}\nimport geometry;\n\nsize(9cm);\npair A = (-0.50099,1.69422);\npair B = (-1.8,-0.6);\npair C =

$\\dang CPD$ in the claim\n(colored green with three rings)\nso that their only dependence on $P$\nis through the angles $\\dang PAC$ and $\\dang CAP$ (colored red with two rings),\nas follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n  -\\dang APB &= \\dang PBA + \\dang BAP = \\dang PBA + (\\dang BAC - \\dang PAC) \\\\\n    &= \\dang CBD + \\dang BAC - \\dang PAC \\\\\n  -\\dang CPD &= \\dang PDC + \\dang DCP = \\dang PDC + (\\dang DCA + \\dang ACP) \\\\\n    &= \\dang ADB + \\dang DCA + \\dang ACP.\n\\end{align*}\nSince the claim says $\\dang APB + \\dang CPD = 0$, summing\nlets us finally rewrite $\\dang PAC - \\dang APC$ in terms of only $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$:\n\\begin{align*}\n  0 &= (\\dang ACP - \\dang PAC) + \\dang ADB + \\dang DCA + \\dang CBD + \\dang BAC \\\\\n  \\implies \\dang PAC - \\dang ACP &= \\dang ADB + \\dang DCA + \\dang CBD + \\dang BAC.\n\\end{align*}\nThese four latter angles are colored blue with one ring in the figure.\nThis proves $(\\spadesuit)$.\n\n\\subparagraph{Quasi-harmonic quadrilaterals.}\nTo interpret the condition $(\\spadesuit)$, we define a new term:\na quadrilateral $ABCD$ is \\emph{quasi-harmonic} if $AB \\cdot CD = BC \\cdot DA$.\n(See IMO 2018/6 for another problem involving quasi-harmonic quadrilaterals.)\nThe following two lemmas show why this condition is relevant:\n\\begin{lemma*}\n  The condition\n  \\[ \\dang BAC + \\dang CBD + \\dang DCA + \\dang ADB = 0 \\]\n  is equivalent to $ABCD$ being \\emph{either} cyclic or quasi-harmonic or both.\n\\end{lemma*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  A clean approach with complex numbers\n  (posted at \\url{https://aops.com/community/p15327734}) goes as follows:\n  define complex numbers $\\mu = (a-b)(c-d) \\neq 0$ and $\\nu = (b-c)(d-a) \\neq 0$.\n  Then \\[ \\mu-\\nu = (a-c)(b-d) \\neq 0. \\]\n\n  Now the angle condition is equivalent to\n  \\begin{align*}\n    \\RR &\\ni \\frac{a-b}{d-b} \\cdot \\frac{b-c}{a-c} \\cdot \\frac{c-d}{b-d} \\cdot \\frac{d-a}{c-a} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{\\mu \\nu}{(\\mu - \\nu)^2} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\mu}{\\nu} + \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu} - 2} \\\\\n    \\iff \\RR &\\ni \\frac{\\mu}{\\nu} + \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu}.\n  \\end{align*}\n  In general, though $z+1/z$ is real exactly when either $|z|=1$ or $z \\in \\RR$.\n  Note $\\mu/\\nu \\in \\RR$ is equivalent to $ABCD$ cyclic\n  and $|\\mu| = |\\nu|$ is equivalent to $ABCD$ being quasiharmonic; the proof follows.\n\n  This can be also proved by inversion at $A$, though we don't write the details here.\n  (See also \\url{https://problems.ru/view_problem_details_new.php?id=116602}).\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lemma*}\n  Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is quasi-harmonic if and only if $P$ lies on line $AC$.\n\\end{lemma*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  Let $X = \\ol{BD} \\cap \\ol{AC}$.\n  If the isogonal of line $BD$ with respect to $\\angle B$ meets line $AC$ at $Y$, then\n  $\\frac{AX}{CX} \\frac{AY}{CY} = \\left( \\frac{BA}{BC} \\right)^2$.\n  Similarly if the isogonal to $\\angle D$ meets line $AC$ at $Y'$, then\n  $\\frac{AX}{CX} \\frac{AY'}{CY'} = \\left( \\frac{DA}{DC} \\right)^2$.\n  Hence $ABCD$ is quasi-harmonic if and only if $Y = Y'$ (that is, $Y=Y'=P$).\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\subparagraph{Wrap-up.}\nWe now show that $PA = PC$ if and only if $ABCD$ is cyclic\nby cases on whether $P$ lies on $\\ol{AC}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\ii If $ABCD$ is \\emph{not} quasi-harmonic,\n  then $(\\spadesuit)$ implies the problem statement immediately.\n  Indeed, $\\dang PAC = \\dang ACP$ if and only if $PA = PC$\n  (as $\\triangle PAC$ is not degenerate)\n  and the second lemma turns our angle condition into $ABCD$ cyclic.\n\n  \\ii Now assume $ABCD$ is quasi-harmonic and $P$ lies on line $AC$.\n  We ignore $(\\spadesuit)$.\n  Instead, note that if $ABCD$ is also cyclic then\n  $\\ol{BD}$ is a symmedian of $\\triangle ABC$ and hence $P$ is the midpoint.\n  Conversely, suppose we know $\\ol{BD}$ is a symmedian of $\\triangle ABC$.\n  Let $D' \\neq B$ be the point for which $ABCD'$ is cyclic and harmonic;\n  then $B$, $D$, $D'$ are collinear and $\\frac{BD}{CD} = \\frac{BD'}{CD'} = \\frac{BA}{CA}$.\n  So $D' = D$ (the corresponding Apollonian circle only meets line $BD$ twice), as needed.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\pagebreak", "category": "Geometry", "source": "IMO", "year": 2004}

$a_{n-1}+a_n=2^n$ for all $n\\geq 4$.\n\\end{mdframed}\nWe present two similar approaches.\n\n\\paragraph{First solution.}\nImagine the counter is moving along\nthe set $S = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2n\\}$ instead,\nstarting at $0$ and ending at $2n$, in jumps of length $1$ and $2$.\nWe can then record the sequence of moves as a matrix of the form\n\\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    p_0 & p_1 & p_2 & \\dots & p_{n-1} & p_n \\\\\n    p_n & p_{n+1} & p_{n+2} & \\dots & p_{2n-1} & p_{2n}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere $p_i = 1$ if the point $i$ was visited by the counter,\nand $p_i = 0$ if the point was not visited by the counter.\nNote that $p_0 = p_{2n} = 1$ and the upper-right and lower-left entries are equal.\nThen, the problem amounts to finding the number of such matrices\nwhich avoid the contiguous submatrices\n\\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\qquad\n  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\qquad\n  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich correspond to forbidding jumps of length greater than $2$,\nrepeating a length $2$ jump and repeating a length $1$ jump.\n\nWe give a nice symmetric phrasing suggested by \\texttt{fclvbfm934} at\n\\url{https://aops.com/community/p27834267}.\nIf we focus on just the three possible column vectors that appear, say\n\\[\n  \\mathbf u \\coloneq \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad\n  \\mathbf v \\coloneq \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad\n  \\mathbf w \\coloneq \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nthen we can instead describe valid matrices\nas sequences of $n+1$ such column vectors,\nwhere no two column vectors are adjacent,\nand where the boundary condition is that\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\ii either we start with $\\mathbf u$ and end with $\\mathbf v$, or\n  \\ii either we start with $\\mathbf w$ and end with $\\mathbf w$.\n\\end{itemize}\nLet $x_n$ and $y_n$ denote the number of such $2 \\times (n+1)$ matrices.\n(Hence $a_n = x_n + y_n$.)\nBut owing to the symmetry of the setup with $\\mathbf u$, $\\mathbf v$, $\\mathbf w$,\nwe could instead view $x_n$ and $y_n$ as the number of $2 \\times (n+1)$ matrices\nfor a fixed starting first column whose final column is the same/different.\nSo we have the recursions\n\\begin{align*}\n  x_{n+1} &= x_n + y_n \\\\\n  y_{n+1} &= 2x_n.\n\\end{align*}\nWe also have that\n\\[ 2x_n + y_n = 2^n \\]\nwhich may either be proved directly from the recursions (using $x_1 = 1$ and $y_1 = 0$),\nor by noting the left-hand side counts the total number of sequences\nof $n+1$ column vectors with no restrictions on the final column at all\n(in which case there are simply $2$ choices for each of the $n$ columns\nafter the first one).\nThus,\n\\begin{align*}\n  a_{n+1} + a_n &= (x_{n+1} + y_{n+1}) + (x_n + y_n) \\\\\n  &= \\left( (x_n + y_n) + 2x_n \\right) + (x_n + y_n) \\\\\n  &= 2(2x_n + y_n) = 2^{n+1}\n\\end{align*}\nas needed.\n\n\\paragraph{Second (longer) solution.}\nIf one does not notice the nice rephrasing with $\\mathbf u$, $\\mathbf v$,\n$\\mathbf w$ above, one may still proceed with the following direct calculation.\nRetain the notation of\n\\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    p_0 & p_1 & p_2 & \\dots & p_{n-1} & p_n \\\\\n    p_n & p_{n+1} & p_{n+2} & \\dots & p_{2n-1} & p_{2n}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\ndescribed earlier.\nWe will for now ignore the boundary conditions.\nInstead we say a $2 \\times m$ matrix is \\emph{silver} ($m \\ge 2$)\nif it avoids the three shapes above.\nWe consider three types of silver matrices\n(essentially doing casework on the last column):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\ii \\emph{type B matrices}, of the shape\n  $\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\dotsb & 1 \\\\\n    0 & \\dotsb & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}$\n\\ii \\emph{type C matrices}, of the shape\n  $\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\dotsb & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\dotsb & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\\ii \\emph{type D matrices}, of the shape\n  $\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\dotsb & 1 \\\\\n    0 & \\dotsb & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nWe let $b_m$, $c_m$, $d_m$\ndenote matrices of each type, of size $2 \\times m$,\nand claim the following two recursions for $m \\ge 4$:\n\\begin{align*}\n  b_m &= c_{m-1} + d_{m-1} \\\\\n  c_m &= b_{m-1} + d_{m-1} \\\\\n  d_m &= b_{m-1} + c_{m-1}.\n\\end{align*}\nIndeed, if we delete the last column of a type B matrix\nand consider what used to be the second-to-last column,\nwe find that it is either type C or type D.\nThis establishes the first recursion and the others are analogous.\n\nNote that $b_2 = 0$ and $c_2 = d_2 = 1$.\nSo using this recursion, the first few values are\n\\[\n  \\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}\n    m  & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 &  6 &  7 &  8 \\\\ \\hline\n    b_m & 0 & 2 & 2 & 6 & 10 & 22 & 42 \\\\\n    c_m & 1 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 11 & 21 & 43 \\\\\n    d_m & 1 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 11 & 21 & 43 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\]\nand a calculation gives $b_m = \\frac{2^{m-1} + 2(-1)^{m-1}}{3}$,\n$c_m = d_m = \\frac{2^{m-1} - (-1)^{m-1}}{3}$.\n\nWe now relate $a_n$ to $b_m$, $c_m$, $d_m$.\nObserve that a matrix as described in the problem is a silver\nmatrix of one of two forms:\n\\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & p_1 & p_2 & \\dots & p_{n-1} & 0 \\\\\n    0 & p_{n+1} & p_{n+2} & \\dots & p_{2n-1} & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\qquad\n  \\text{or}\\qquad\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & p_1 & p_2 & \\dots & p_{n-1} & 1 \\\\\n    1 & p_{n+1} & p_{n+2} & \\dots & p_{2n-1} & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThere are $c_{n+1}$ matrices of the first form.\nMoreover, there are $2d_n$ matrices of the second form\n(to see this, delete the first column;\nwe either get a type-D matrix\nor an upside-down type-D matrix).\nThus we get\n\\[ a_n = c_{n+1} + 2d_n\n  = \\frac{2^{n+1} + (-1)^{n+1}}{3}. \\]\nThis implies the result.\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  The two solutions are closely related.\n  In fact, $c_n = x_{n-1}$ and $b_n = y_{n-1}$.\n  So the second solution is really the same as the first solution,\n  except the symmetry of $\\mathbf u$, $\\mathbf v$, $\\mathbf w$ was not noticed,\n  thus requiring a third recursion to handle all the cases manually.\n\\end{remark*}\n\\pagebreak", "category": "Combinatorics",

By comparing expectations, we have $3C + A = 4A$,\nso $A = C$ and $4A + 3B = \\pi$.\n\nWe will compute $B + 2A = B + 2C$, which is the expected area of the part\nof the circle cut off by a chord through two random points $D,E$, on the\nside of the chord not containing a third random point $F$.\nLet $h$ be the distance from the center $O$ of the circle to the line $DE$.\nWe now determine the distribution of $h$.\n\nPut $r = OD$; the distribution of $r$ is $2r$ on $[0,1]$.\nWithout loss of generality, suppose $O$ is the origin and\n$D$ lies on the positive $x$-axis.\nFor fixed $r$, the distribution of $h$ runs over $[0,r]$,\nand can be computed as the area of the infinitesimal region in which\n$E$ can be chosen so the chord through $DE$ has distance to $O$\nbetween $h$ and $h+dh$, divided by $\\pi$.\nThis region splits into two symmetric pieces, one of which lies\nbetween chords making angles of $\\arcsin(h/r)$ and\n$\\arcsin((h + dh)/r)$ with the $x$-axis.\nThe angle between these is $d\\theta = dh/(r^2 - h^2)$.\nDraw the chord through $D$ at distance $h$ to $O$, and let $L_1,L_2$ be the\nlengths of the parts on opposite sides of $D$; then\nthe area we are looking for is $\\frac{1}{2}(L_1^2 + L_2^2) d\\theta$.\nSince\n\\[\n\\{L_1, L_2 \\} = \\sqrt{1-h^2} \\pm \\sqrt{r^2 - h^2},\n\\]\nthe area we are seeking (after doubling) is\n\\[\n2\\frac{1 + r^2 - 2h^2}{\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}}.\n\\]\nDividing by $\\pi$, then integrating over $r$, we compute the distribution\nof $h$ to be\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_h^1 2 \\frac{1 + r^2 - 2h^2}{\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}} 2r\\,dr \\\\\n&= \\frac{16}{3\\pi} (1-h^2)^{3/2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe now return to computing $B +2A$.\nLet $A(h)$ denote the smaller of the two areas of the disc cut off\nby a chord at distance $h$.\nThe chance that the third point is in the smaller (resp.\\\nlarger) portion is $A(h)/\\pi$ (resp.\\ $1 - A(h)/\\pi$),\nand then the area we are trying to compute is $\\pi - A(h)$\n(resp.\\ $A(h)$).\nUsing the distribution on $h$,\nand the fact that\n\\begin{align*}\nA(h) &= 2 \\int_h^1 \\sqrt{1-h^2}\\,dh \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2}  - \\arcsin(h) - h \\sqrt{1-h^2},\n\\end{align*}\nwe find\n\\begin{align*}\n&B+2A \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^1 A(h) (\\pi - A(h))\\, \\frac{16}{3\\pi} (1-h^2)^{3/2}\n\\,dh \\\\\n&= \\frac{35 + 24 \\pi^2}{72 \\pi}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $4A + 3B = \\pi$, we solve to obtain\n$A = \\frac{35}{48 \\pi}$ as in the first solution.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:} (by Noam Elkies)\nAgain, we reduce to computing the average area of a triangle formed by\nthree random points $A,B,C$ inside a unit circle.\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle, and put $c = \\max\\{OA,OB,OC\\}$;\nthen the probability that $c \\leq r$ is $(r^2)^3$, so the distribution\nof $c$ is $6c^5\\,dc$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nGiven $c$, the expectation of $[ABC]$ is equal to $c^2$ times $X$, the expected\narea of a triangle formed by two random points $P,Q$ in a circle and\na fixed point $R$ on the boundary.

consider this right action.\n  First we consider the color of the square after each second.\n  Note that with respect to color, each letter is an involution;\n  so as far as color changes are concerned,\n  it's enough to work with the reduced word $w'$ obtained by modding out by $h^2 = 1$ and $v^2 = 1$.\n  (For example, $w' = hv$ in our example.)\n  In general, $w' = (hv)^k$ or $w' = (vh)^k$,\n  for some odd integer $k$ (since $k \\equiv r \\equiv s \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$).\n  Now we see that the action of $hv$\n  on the set of colors is\n  $\\text{red} \\mapsto \\text{blue} \\mapsto \\text{green} \\mapsto \\text{red}$,\n  and similarly for $vh$ (being the inverse).\n  This implies that the color is periodic every three seconds.\n\\end{proof}\n\nNow in a 3-second period,\nconsider the $3r$ horizontal events and $3s$ vertical events (both are odd).\nIn order for the color to remain the same\n(as the only color changes are $R \\leftrightarrow G$ for $h$ and $B \\leftrightarrow G$ for $v$)\nthere must have been an even number of color swaps for each orientation.\nTherefore there was an odd number of wall collisions of each orientation.\nSo, the laser is pointing in the opposite direction at the end of 3 seconds.\n\nFinally, let $x_t$ be the fractional part of the $x$\ncoordinate after $t$ seconds\n(the $y$-coordinate is always zero by our setup at these moments).\nNote that\n\\[ x_{t+1} =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    x_t & \\text{even number of vertical wall collisions} \\\\\n    1 - x_t & \\text{odd numbers of vertical wall collisions}\n  \\end{cases}\n\\]\nSince over the three seconds there were an odd number of vertical collisions;\nit follows $x_3 = 1 - x_0$.\nThus at the end of three seconds, the laser is in a symmetric position from the start;\nand in $6$ seconds it will form a closed loop.\n\\pagebreak\n\n\\section{Solutions to Day 2}", "category": "Geometry", "source": "TSTST", "year": 2013}

both sizes are almost the same.\n  At that moment we may adjust something.\n\n  Trying the idea, I had some difficulties\n  keeping track of the maximal cliques in the both rooms.\n  It seemed easier all the students in one of the rooms to comprise a clique.\n  It could be achieved by moving only the members of the maximal clique.\n  Following this path the remaining obstacles can be overcome

$A$, $I$, $I_A$\n  that $D$, $I$, $A_2$ are collinear as well.\n\n  The other two claims follow in a dual fashion.\n  For example, using the homothety taking the $A$ to $C$-excircle,\n  we find that $\\ol{C_1I_C}$ bisects the altitude $\\ol{BE}$.\n  (The homothety at $B$ will send $C_1$ to the point on the $C$-excircle which is\n  diametrically opposite the foot from $I_C$ to $AC$. This diameter of the\n  $C$-excircle is then mapped through homothety through $C_1$ onto the $B$-altitude.)\n  Then since $I_C$, $B$, $I_A$ are collinear the same argument\n  now gives $I_C$, $E$, $C_2$ are collinear.\n  The fact that $I_B$, $F$, $B_2$ are collinear is symmetric.\n\\end{proof}\n\nObserve that $\\ol{B_2C_2} \\parallel \\ol{B_1C_1} \\parallel \\ol{I_B I_C}$.\nProceeding similarly on the other sides,\nwe discover $\\triangle I I_B I_C$ and $\\triangle A_2 B_2 C_2$ are homothetic.\nHence $P$ is the center of this homothety (in particular, $D$, $I$, $P$, $A_2$ are collinear).\nMoreover, $P$ lies on the line joining $I_A$ to $S$,\nwhich is the Euler line of $\\triangle I I_B I_C$,\nso it passes through the nine-point center of $\\triangle I I_B I_C$,\nwhich is $O$. Consequently, $P$, $O$, $I_A$ are collinear as well.\n\nTo finish, we need only prove that $\\ol{OS} \\perp \\ol{YZ}$.\nIn fact, we claim that $\\ol{YZ}$ is the radical axis\nof the circumcircles of $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle I I_B I_C$.\nActually, $Y$ is the radical center of these two circumcircles\nand the circle with diameter $\\ol{II_B}$\n(which passes through $A$ and $C$).\nAnalogously $Z$ is the radical center of the circumcircles\nand the circle with diameter $\\ol{II_C}$, and the proof is complete.\n\n\\paragraph{Second solution (barycentric, outline, Colin Tang).}\nwe are going to use barycentric coordinates\nto show that the line through $O$ perpendicular to $\\ol{YZ}$\nis concurrent with $\\ol{I_B F}$ and $\\ol{I_C E}$.\n\nThe displacement vector $\\overrightarrow{YZ}$\nis proportional to $(a(b-c):-b(a+c):c(a+b))$,\nand so by strong perpendicularity criterion\nand doing a calculation gives the line\n\\[ x(b-c)bc(a+b+c) + y(a+c)ac(a+b-c) + z(a+b)ab(-a+b-c) = 0. \\]\nOn the other hand, line $I_C E$ has equation\n\\[\n  0 =\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a &  b & -c \\\\\n    S_C & 0 & S_A \\\\\n    x & y & z\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  = bS_a \\cdot x + (-cS_C-aS_A) \\cdot y + (-bS_C) \\cdot z\n\\]\nand similarly for $I_B F$.\nConsequently, concurrence of these lines is equivalent to\n\\[\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n    bS_A & -cS_C - aS_A & -bS_C \\\\\n    cS_A & -cS_B & -aS_A - bS_B \\\\\n    (b-c)bc(a+b+c) & (a+c)ac(a+b-c) & (a+b)ab(-a+b-c)\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  = 0\n\\]\nwhich is a computation.\n\n\\paragraph{Authorship comments.}\nI was intrigued by a Taiwan TST problem which implied that,\nin the configuration above, $\\angle I_B D I_C$ was bisected by $\\ol{DA}$.\nThis motivated me to draw all three properties above where $I_A$ and $P$\nwere isogonal conjugates with respect to $DEF$.\nAfter playing around with this picture for a long time,\nI finally noticed that $O$ was on line $PI_A$.\n(So the original was to show that $I_B F$, $I_C E$, $DA_2$ concurrent).\nEventually I finally noticed in the picture that $PI_A$\nactually passed through the circumcenter of $ABC$ as well.\nThis took me many hours to prove.\n\nThe final restatement (which follows quickly from $P$, $O$, $I_A$ collinear)\nwas discovered by Telv Cohl when I showed him the problem.\n\\pagebreak\n\n\\section{Solutions to Day 2}", "category": "Geometry", "source": "USAMO", "year": 2016}

By Lemma~1 of the first solution, this count equals $n^k$ times the number of functions with $f(1) = \\cdots = f(k) = 1$  which iterate $X$ into $\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$. For such a function $f$, put $S = \\{k+1,\\dots,n\\} \\cap f^{-1}(\\{1,\\dots,k\\})$ and let $g$ be the contraction of $f$\nat $\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$; then $g^{-1}(*) = * \\cup \\{S\\}$ and $g$ iterates \nits domain into $*$.

following two claims,\nwhich will show that $S(G) \\le 127010$ for all graphs $G$.\nThen a careful analysis of the equality cases will show\nthat this bound is not achieved for any graph $G$.\nSince the example $L_{64}$ earlier has $S(L_{64}) = 127009$,\nthis will solve the problem.\n\n\\begin{lemma*}\n  [Combinatorial bound]\n  Let $G$ be a graph with $2017$ edges and let\n  $d_1 \\ge d_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge d_n$ be the degree sequence of the graph\n  (thus $n \\ge 65$).\n  Then \\[ S(G) \\le d_2 + 2d_3 + 3d_4 + \\dots + 63d_{64} + d_{65}. \\]\n\\end{lemma*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  Let $v_1$, \\dots, $v_n$ be the corresponding vertices.\n  For any edge $e = \\{v_i, v_j\\}$ with $i < j$,\n  we consider associating each edge $e$ with $v_j$,\n  and computing the sum $S(G)$ indexing over associated vertices.\n  To be precise, if we let $a_i$ denote the number of edges\n  associated to $v_i$, we now have $a_i \\le i-1$, $\\sum a_i = 2017$, and\n  \\[ S(G) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i d_i. \\]\n  The inequality\n  $\\sum a_i d_i \\le d_2 + 2d_3 + 3d_4 + \\dots + 63d_{64} + d_{65}$\n  then follows for smoothing reasons\n  (by ``smoothing'' the $a_i$), since the $d_i$ are monotone.\n  This proves the given inequality.\n\\end{proof}\n\nOnce we have this property, we handle the bounding completely algebraically.\n\\begin{lemma*}\n  [Algebraic bound]\n  Let $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge x_{65}$ be any nonnegative integers\n  such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{65} x_i \\le 4034$.\n  Then \\[ x_2 + 2x_3 + \\dots + 63x_{64} + x_{65} \\le 127010. \\]\n  Moreover, equality occurs if and only if\n  $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \\dots = x_{64} = 63$ and $x_{65} = 2$.\n\\end{lemma*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  Let $A$ denote the left-hand side of the inequality.\n  We begin with a smoothing argument.\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\ii Suppose there are indices $1 \\le i < j \\le 64$\n    such that $x_i > x_{i+1} \\ge x_{j-1} > x_j$.\n    Then replacing $(x_i, x_j)$ by $(x_i-1, x_j+1)$\n    strictly increases $A$ preserving all conditions.\n    Thus we may assume all numbers in $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_{64}\\}$\n    differ by at most $1$.\n    \\ii Suppose $x_{65} \\ge 4$.\n    Then we can replace $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_{65})$\n    by $(x_1+1, x_2+1, x_3+1, x_4+1, x_{65}-4)$\n    and strictly increase $A$.\n    Hence we may assume $x_{65} \\le 3$.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  We will also tacitly assume $\\sum x_i = 4034$,\n  since otherwise we can increase $x_1$.\n  These two properties leave only four sequences to examine:\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\ii $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \\dots = x_{63} = 63$, $x_{64} = 62$,\n    and $x_{65} = 3$, which gives $A = 126948$.\n    \\ii $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \\dots = x_{63} = x_{64} = 63$ and $x_{65} = 2$,\n    which gives $A = 127010$.\n    \\ii $x_1 = 64$, $x_2 = x_3 = \\dots = x_{63} = x_{64} = 63$ and $x_{65} = 1$,\n    which gives $A = 127009$.\n    \\ii $x_1 = x_2 = 64$, $x_3 = \\dots = x_{63} = x_{64} = 63$ and $x_{65} = 0$,\n    which gives $A = 127009$.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  This proves that $A \\le 127010$.\n  To see that equality occurs only in the second case above,\n  note that all the smoothing operations other than incrementing $x_1$ were strict,\n  and that $x_1$ could not have been incremented in this way\n  as $x_1 = x_2 = 63$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThis shows that $S(G) \\le 127010$ for all graphs $G$,\nso it remains to show equality never occurs.\nRetain the notation $d_i$ and $a_i$ of the combinatorial bound now;\nwe would need to have $d_1 = \\dots = d_{64} = 63$ and $d_{65} = 2$\n(in particular, deleting isolated vertices from $G$, we may assume $n=65$).\nIn that case, we have $a_i \\le i-1$ but also $a_{65} = 2$ by definition\n(the last vertex gets all edges associated to it).\nFinally,\n\\begin{align*}\n  S(G) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i d_i = 63(a_1 + \\dots + a_{64}) + a_{65} \\\\\n  &= 63(2017-a_{65}) + a_{65} \\le 63 \\cdot 2015 + 2 = 126947\n\\end{align*}\ncompleting the proof.\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  Another way to finish once $S(G) \\le 127010$\n  is note there is a unique graph\n  (up to isomorphism and deletion of universal vertices)\n  with degree sequence\n  $(d_1, \\dots, d_{65}) = (63, \\dots, 63, 2)$.\n  Indeed, the complement of the graph\n  has degree sequence $(1, \\dots, 1, 63)$,\n  and so it must be a $63$-star plus a single edge.\n  One can then compute $S(G)$ explicitly for this graph.\n\\end{remark*}\n\n\\paragraph{Some further remarks.}\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  Interestingly, the graph $C_4$ has $\\binom 32+1 = 4$ edges\n  and $S(C_4) = 8$, while $S(L_3) = 7$.\n  This boundary case is visible in the combinatorial solution\n  in the base case of the first claim.\n  It also explains why we end up with the bound $S(G) \\le 127010$\n  in the second algebraic solution,\n  and why it is necessary to analyze the equality cases so carefully;\n  observe in $k=3$ the situation $d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = d_4 = 2$.\n\\end{remark*}\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  Some comments about further context for this problem:\n  \\begin{itemize}\n  \\ii The obvious generalization of $2017$ to any constant\n  was resolved in September 2018 by Mehtaab Sawhney and Ashwin Sah.\n  The relevant paper is\n  \\emph{On the discrepancy between two Zagreb indices},\n  published in Discrete Mathematics, Volume 341, Issue 9, pages 2575-2589.\n  The arXiv link is \\url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02532.pdf}.\n\n  \\ii The quantity\n  \\[ S(G) = \\sum_{e = vw} \\min \\left( \\deg v, \\deg w \\right) \\]\n  in the problem has an interpretation:\n  it can be used to provide a bound on the\n  number of triangles in a graph $G$.\n  To be precise, $\\# E(G) \\le \\frac 13 S(G)$,\n  since an edge $e = vw$ is part of at most $\\min(\\deg v, \\deg w)$ triangles.\n\n  \\ii For \\emph{planar} graphs it is known $S(G) \\le 18n-36$\n  and it is conjectured that for $n$ large enough, $S(G) \\le 18n-72$.\n  See \\url{https://mathoverflow.net/a/273694/70654}.\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\end{remark*}\n\n\\paragraph{Authorship comments.}\nI came up with the quantity $S(G)$\nin a failed attempt to provide a bound on the number of triangles in a graph,\nsince this is natural to consider when you do a standard\ndouble-counting via the edges of the triangle.\nI think the problem was actually APMO 1989,\nand I ended up not solving the problem (the solution is much simpler),\nbut the quantity $S(G)$ stuck in my head for a while after that.\n\nLater on that month I was keeping Danielle company while\nshe was working on art project (flower necklace),\nand with not much to do except doodle on tables\nI began thinking about $S(G)$ again.\nI did have the sense that $S(G)$ should be maximized\nat a graph close to a complete graph.\nBut to my frustration I could not prove it for a long time.\nFinally after many hours of trying various approaches\nI was able to at least show that $S(G)$ was maximized\nfor complete graphs if the number of edges was a triangular number.\n\nI had come up with this in March 2016,\nwhich would have been perfect since $2016$ is a triangular number,\nbut it was too late to submit it to any contest\n(the USAMO and IMO deadlines were long past).\nSo on December 31, 2016 I finally sat down and solved it for the case $2017$,\nwhich took another few hours of thought, then submitted it to that year's IMO.\nTo my dismay it was rejected, but I passed it along to the USA TST after that,\nthus making it just in time for the close of the calendar year.\n\\pagebreak\n\n\\section{Solutions to Day 2}", "category": "Combinatorics",

cyclic.\n\\end{lemma*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  This is direct angle chasing.\n  In fact, $\\ol{HM}$ passes through the circumcenter of $\\triangle BHC$\n  and $\\triangle HAD \\sim \\triangle HCB$,\n  so $\\ol{HS}$ ought to be the altitude of $\\triangle HAD$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nFrom here it follows that $E$ is the Miquel point of\ncyclic quadrilateral $BTSD$.\nDefine $F$ to be the point diametrically opposite $A$,\nso that $E$, $H$, $F$ are collinear, $\\ol{CF} \\parallel \\ol{BD}$.\nBy now we already have\n\\[ \\dang BEH = \\dang BEF = \\dang BAF = \\dang CAD = \\dang HAS = \\dang HES \\]\nso $\\ol{EH}$ bisects $\\angle BES$, and $\\angle TED$.\nHence it only remains to show $\\angle BEM = \\angle NED$;\nwe present several proofs below.\n\n\\paragraph{First proof (original solution).}\nLet $P$ be the circumcenter of $BTSD$.\nThe properties of the Miquel point imply $P$ lies on\nthe common bisector $\\ol{EH}$ already,\nand it also lies on the perpendicular bisector of $\\ol{BD}$,\nhence it must be the midpoint of $\\ol{HF}$.\n\nWe now contend quadrilaterals $BMPS$ and $DNPT$ are cyclic.\nObviously $\\ol{MP}$ is the external angle bisector of $\\angle BMS$,\nand $PB = PS$, so $P$ is the arc midpoint of $(BMS)$.\nThe proof for $DNPT$ is analogous.\n\nIt remains to show $\\angle BEN = \\angle MED$,\nor equivalently $\\angle BEM = \\angle NED$.\nBy properties of Miquel point we have $E \\in (BMPS) \\cap (TPND)$, so\n\\[ \\dang BEM = \\dang BPM = \\dang PBD = \\dang BDP = \\dang NPD = \\dang NED \\]\nas desired.\n\n\\paragraph{Second proof (2011 G4).}\nBy 2011 G4, the circumcircle of $\\triangle EMN$\nis tangent to the circumcircle of $ABCD$.\nHence if we extend $\\ol{EM}$ and $\\ol{EN}$ to meet $(ABCD)$\nagain at $X$ and $Y$, we get $\\ol{XY} \\parallel \\ol{MN} \\parallel \\ol{BD}$.\nThus $\\dang BEM = \\dang BEX = \\dang YED = \\dang NED$.\n\n\\paragraph{Third proof (involutions, submitted by Daniel Liu).}\nLet $G = \\ol{BN} \\cap \\ol{MD}$ denote the centroid of $\\triangle BCD$,\nand note that it lies on $\\ol{EHF}$.\n\nNow consider the dual of Desargues involution theorem on complete\nquadrilateral $BMDNCG$ at point $E$.\nWe get\n\\[ (EB,ED), \\quad (EM,EN), \\quad (EC,EG) \\]\nform an involutive pairing.\n\nHowever, the bisector of $\\angle BED$, say $\\ell$,\nis also the angle bisector of $\\angle CEF$ (since $\\ol{CF} \\parallel \\ol{BD}$).\nSo the involution we found must coincide with reflection across $\\ell$.\nThis means $\\angle MEN$ is bisected by $\\ell$ as well, as desired.\n\n\\paragraph{Authorship comments.}\nThis diagram actually comes from the inverted\npicture in IMO 2014/3 (which I attended).\nI had heard for many years that one could\nsolve this problem quickly by inversion at $H$ afterwards.\nBut when I actually tried to do it during an OTIS class\nyears later, I ended up with the picture in the TST problem,\nand couldn't see why it was true!\nIn the process of trying to reconstruct this rumored solution,\nI ended up finding most of the properties\nthat ended up in the January TST problem\n(but were overkill for the original IMO problem).\n\nLet us make the equivalence explicit\nby deducing the IMO problem from our work.\n\nLet rays $EM$ and $EN$ meet the circumcircles of $\\triangle BHC$\nand $\\triangle BNC$ again at $X$ and $Y$, with $EM < EX$ and $EN < EY$.\nAs above we concluded $EM/EX = EN/EY$\nand so $\\ol{MN} \\parallel \\ol{XY} \\implies \\ol{XY} \\perp \\ol{AHC}$.\n\nNow consider an inversion at $H$ which swaps\n$B \\leftrightarrow D$ and $A \\leftrightarrow C$.\nThe point $E$ goes to $E^\\ast$ diametrically opposite $A$.\nPoints $X$ and $Y$ go to points on $X^\\ast \\in \\ol{AD}$ and $Y^\\ast \\in \\ol{AB}$.\nSince the reflection of $E$ across $\\ol{PX}$ is supposed to lie on $(BAE)$,\nit follows that the circumcenter of $\\triangle HX^\\ast E^\\ast$\nlies on $\\ol{AD}$.\nConsequently $X^\\ast$ plays the role of point ``$T$'' in the IMO problem.\nThen

barycentric coordinates with resect to $\\triangle ABC$\nto bound the degrees suitably,\nand then verify for seven distinct choices of $S$.\n\nWe let $R$ denote the radius of $\\triangle ABC$,\nand $N$ the nine-point center.\n\nFirst, imagine solving for $X$ in the following way.\nSuppose $\\vec X = (1-t_a) \\vec M_a + t_a \\vec S$.\nThen, using the dot product\n(with $\\left\\lvert \\vec v \\right\\rvert^2 = \\vec v \\cdot \\vec v$ in general)\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\frac14 R^2\n  &= \\left\\lvert \\vec X - \\vec N \\right\\rvert^2 \\\\\n  &= \\left\\lvert t_a(\\vec S - \\vec M_a) + \\vec M_a - \\vec N \\right\\rvert^2 \\\\\n  &= \\left\\lvert t_a(\\vec S - \\vec M_a) \\right\\rvert^2\n    + 2t_a \\left( \\vec S - \\vec M_a \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\vec M_a - \\vec N \\right)\n    + \\left\\lvert \\vec M_a - \\vec N \\right\\rvert^2 \\\\\n  &= t_a^2 \\left\\lvert (\\vec S - \\vec M_a) \\right\\rvert^2\n    + 2t_a \\left( \\vec S - \\vec M_a \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\vec M_a - \\vec N \\right)\n    + \\frac 14 R^2\n\\end{align*}\nSince $t_a \\neq 0$ we may solve to obtain\n\\[ t_a = -\\frac{2(\\vec M_a - \\vec N) \\cdot (\\vec S - \\vec M_a)}%\n  {\\left\\lvert \\vec S - \\vec M_a \\right\\rvert^2}.  \\]\nNow imagine $S$ varies along the Euler line,\nmeaning there should exist linear functions\n$\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\colon \\RR \\to \\RR$ such that\n\\[ S = \\left( \\alpha(s) , \\beta(s) , \\gamma(s) \\right)\n  \\qquad s \\in \\RR \\]\nwith $\\alpha(s) + \\beta(s) + \\gamma(s) = 1$.\nThus $t_a = \\frac{f_a}{g_a} = \\frac{f_a(s)}{g_a(s)}$\nis the quotient of a linear function\n$f_a(s)$ and a quadratic function $g_a(s)$.\n\nSo we may write:\n\\begin{align*}\n  X &= (1-t_a) \\left( 0, \\half, \\half \\right)\n    + t_a \\left( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\right) \\\\\n  &= \\left( t_a \\alpha, \\half(1-t_a) + t_a \\beta,\n    \\half(1-t_a) + t_a \\gamma \\right) \\\\\n  &= \\left( 2f_a \\alpha : g_a - f_a + 2f_a \\beta : g_a - f_a + 2 f_a \\gamma \\right).\n\\end{align*}\nThus the coordinates of $X$ are quadratic polynomials in $s$\nwhen written in this way.\n\nIn a similar way, the coordinates of $Y$ and $Z$\nshould be quadratic polynomials in $s$.\nThe Ceva concurrence condition\n\\[ \\prod_{\\text{cyc}} \\frac{g_a-f_a+2f_a\\beta}{g_a-f_a+2f_a\\gamma}\n  = 1 \\]\nis thus a polynomial in $s$ of degree at most six.\nOur goal is to verify it is identically zero,\nthus it suffices to check seven positions of $S$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\ii If $S$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle M_a M_b M_c$\n  (equivalently the nine-point center of $\\triangle ABC$)\n  then $\\ol{AX}$, $\\ol{BY}$, $\\ol{CZ}$\n  are altitudes of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\n  \\ii If $S$ is the centroid of $\\triangle M_a M_b M_c$\n  (equivalently the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$),\n  then $\\ol{AX}$, $\\ol{BY}$, $\\ol{CZ}$\n  are medians of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\n  \\ii If $S$ is either of the intersections of the Euler\n  line with $\\gamma$, then $S = X = Y = Z$\n  and all cevians concur at $S$.\n\n  \\ii If $S$ lies on the $\\ol{M_a M_b}$,\n  then $Y = M_a$, $X = M_c$, and thus $\\ol{AX} \\cap \\ol{BY} = C$,\n  which is of course concurrent with $\\ol{CZ}$\n  (regardless of $Z$).\n  Similarly if $S$ lies on the other sides of $\\triangle M_a M_b M_c$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThus we are also done.\n\n\\paragraph{Fourth solution using

= 90\\dg$,\nand moreover that $\\ol{TA}$, $\\ol{TD}$ are tangents to $\\Gamma$,\nwhence we also have $M = \\ol{TO} \\cap \\ol{AD}$.\nThus $M$ lies on both $(BOC)$ and $(AT)$.\nThis solves part (a) of the problem:\nthe concurrency point is the symmedian point of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nNow, note that since $K$ is the Miquel point,\n\\[ \\frac{ZK}{YK} = \\frac{ZB}{YC} = \\frac{ZA}{YA} \\]\nand hence $\\ol{KA}$ is an angle bisector of $\\angle ZKY$.\nThus from $(TA;YZ)=-1$ we obtain $\\angle TKA = 90\\dg$.\n\nIt remains to show $\\ol{AK}$ passes through a fixed point on the Euler line.\nWe claim it is the exsimilicenter of $\\Gamma$ and $\\Omega$.\nLet $L$ be the midpoint of the arc $YZ$ of $\\triangle XYZ$ not containing $X$.\nThen we know that $K$, $A$, $L$ are collinear.\nNow the positive homothety sending $\\Gamma$ to $\\Omega$ maps $A$ to $L$;\nthis proves the claim.\nFinally, it is well-known that the line through $O$\nand the circumcenter of $\\triangle XYZ$\ncoincides with the Euler line of $\\triangle ABC$;\nhence done.\n\nA second approach to (b) presented by many contestants\nis to take an inversion around the circumcircle of $ABC$.\nIn that situation, the part reduces to the following\nknown lemma: if $\\ol{AH_a}$, $\\ol{BH_b}$, $\\ol{CH_c}$\nare the altitudes of a triangle,\nthen the circumcircles of triangles $OAH_a$, $BOH_b$, $COH_c$\nare coaxial, and the radical axis coincides with the Euler line.\nIndeed one simply observes that the orthocenter\nhas equal power to all three circles.\n\n\\paragraph{Authorship comments.}\nThis problem was inspired by the fact that $K$, $A$, $L$\nare collinear in the figure,\nwhich was produced by one of my students (Ryan Kim)\nin a solution to a homework problem.\nI realized for example that this implied that line $AK$\npassed through the $X_{56}$ point of $\\triangle XYZ$\n(which lies on the Euler line of $\\triangle ABC$).\n\nThis problem was the result of playing around with\nthe resulting very nice picture:\nall the power comes from the ``magic'' point $K$.\n\\pagebreak", "category": "Geometry", "source": "TST", "year": 2017}

\\half \\binom{n-1}{\\frac{n-1}{2}} + 1$.\nThis gives the best possible value at both $n=2$ and $n=3$.\nIt seems likely some further improvements are possible,\nand the true bound is suspected to be polynomial in $n$.\n\nSecondly, the solution is highly motivated by considering a true/false contest\nin which only two distinct answers are given per question.\nHowever, a natural mistake (which graders assessed as a two-point deduction)\nis to try and prove that in fact one can ``WLOG'' we are in the two-question case.\nThe proof of this requires substantially more care than expected.\nFor instance, set $n = 3$.\nIf $\\mathcal L = \\left\\{ \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}  \\right\\}$\nthen it becomes impossible to prevent a duplicate set from appearing\nin $\\mathcal L$ if all contestants give distinct answers.\nOne might attempt to fix this by instead adding to $\\mathcal L$\nthe \\emph{complement} of the set $T$ described above.\nThe example $\\mathcal L = \\left\\{ \\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,1\\}  \\right\\}$\n(followed again by a round with all distinct answers)\nshows that this proposed fix does not work either.\nThis issue affects all variations of the above approach.\n\nBecause the USA TST did not have any solution-writing process at this time,\nthis issue was not noticed until January 15 (less than a week before the exam).\nWhen it was brought up by email by Evan,\nevery organizer who had testsolved the problem had apparently made the same error.\n\\end{remark*}\n\\begin{remark*}\n  Here are some motivations for the solution:\n  \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\ii The exponential bound $2^n$ suggests looking at subsets.\n    \\ii The $n = 2$ case suggests the idea of ``repeated rounds''.\n    (I think this $n=2$ case is actually really good.)\n    \\ii The ``two distinct answers'' case suggests looking at rounds\n    as partitions (even though the WLOG does not work,\n    at least not without further thought).\n    \\ii There's something weird about this problem:\n    it's a finite bound over unbounded time.\n    This is a hint to \\emph{not} worry excessively about\n    the actual scores, which turn out to be almost irrelevant.\n  \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{remark*}\n\\pagebreak", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "TST", "year": 2017}

Applying this to $n=5$ and $k=403$, we find that $a_{2015}$ is divisible by $a_5 = 362$ and thus by $181$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nBy rewriting the formula for $a_n$ as $a_{n-2} = 4a_{n-1} - a_n$, we may extend the sequence backwards to define $a_n$ for all integers $n$. Since $a_{-1} = 2$, we may see by induction that $a_{-n} = a_n$ for all $n$. For any integer $m$ and any prime $p$ dividing $a_m$,\n$p$ also divides $a_{-m}$; on the other hand, $p$ cannot divide $a_{-m+1}$, as otherwise $p$ would also divide $a_{-m+2}, \\dots, a_0 = 1$, a contradiction. We can thus find an integer $k$ such that $a_{m+1} \\equiv k a_{-m+1} \\pmod{p}$; by induction on $n$, we see that\n$a_n \\equiv k a_{n-2m} \\pmod{p}$ for all $n$.

On the other hand, from the expression for $D$, an easy induction on $k$ shows that\n$D^k = (2\\alpha)^k \\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} \\gamma^2 p_{k-1} & \\gamma p_k \\\\\n\\gamma p_k & p_{k+1} \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$, where $p_k$ is defined inductively by $p_0 = 0$, $p_1 = 1$, $p_{k+2} = \\gamma^2 p_k + p_{k+1}$. In particular, it follows from the inductive definition that $p_k > 0$ when $k \\geq 1$, whence the upper left entry of $D^k$ is nonzero when $k \\geq 2$, a contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nA variant of this solution can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix $M$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nIf $a,b,c,d$ are in arithmetic progression, then we may write\n\\[\na = r-3s, b=r-s, c=r+s, d=r+3s\n\\]\nfor some $r,s$. If $s=0$, then clearly all powers of $M$ are in $xS$. Also, if $r=0$, then one easily checks that $M^3$ is in $S$.\n\nWe now assume $rs\\neq 0$, and show that in that case $M$ cannot be in $S$. First, note that the characteristic polynomial of $M$ is $x^2-2rx-8s^2$, and since $M$ is nonsingular (as $s\\neq 0$), this is also the minimal polynomial of $M$ by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.  By repeatedly using the relation $M^2=2rM+8s^2I$, we see that for each positive integer, we have $M^k = t_k M + u_k I$ for unique real constants $t_k, u_k$ (uniqueness follows from the independence of $M$ and $I$).  Since $M$ is in $S$, we see that $M^k$ lies in $S$ only if $u_k=0$.\n\nOn the other hand, we claim that if $k>1$, then $rt_k>0$ and $u_k>0$ if $k$ is even, and $t_k>0$ and $ru_k>0$ if $k$ is odd (in particular, $u_k$ can never be zero).  The claim is true for $k=2$ by the relation $M^2=2rM+8s^2I$. Assuming the claim for $k$, and multiplying both sides of the relation $M^k = t_k M + u_k I$ by $M$, yields\n\\[\nM^{k+1} = t_k (2rM+8s^2I) + u_k M = (2rt_k+u_k) M + 8s^2t_k I,\n\\]\nimplying the claim for $k+1$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\n(from \\url{artofproblemsolving.com}, user \\texttt{hoeij})\nOnce one has $u_k = 0$, one can also finish using the relation $M \\cdot M^k = M^k \\cdot M$.", "category": "Algebra", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2015}

But then $f(f(x)) > 1$ for sufficiently large $x$, a contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\n(Communicated by Catalin Zara.)\nSuppose such a function exists. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and differentiable, so is $f \\circ f = f'$.\nIn particular, $f$ is twice differentiable; also, $f''(x) = f'(f(x)) f'(x)$ is the product of two strictly\nincreasing nonnegative functions, so it is also strictly increasing and nonnegative. In particular, we can choose\n$\\alpha>0$ and $M \\in \\RR$ such that $f''(x) > 4\\alpha$ for all $x \\geq M$. Then for all $x \\geq M$,\n\\[\nf(x) \\geq f(M) + f'(M)(x-M) + 2\\alpha (x-M)^2.\n\\]\nIn particular, for some $M' > M$, we have $f(x) \\geq \\alpha x^2$ for all $x \\geq M'$.\n\nPick $T>0$ so that $\\alpha T^2 > M'$. Then for $x \\geq T$,\n$f(x) > M'$ and so $f'(x) = f(f(x)) \\geq \\alpha f(x)^2$.\nNow\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f(T)} - \\frac{1}{f(2T)}\n= \\int_T^{2T} \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2}\\,dt \\geq \\int_T^{2T} \\alpha\\,dt;\n\\]\nhowever, as $T \\to \\infty$, the left side of this inequality\ntends to 0 while the right side tends to $+\\infty$,\na contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution.}\n(Communicated by Noam Elkies.)\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing, for some $y_0$, we can define the inverse function\n$g(y)$ of $f$ for $y \\geq y_0$. Then $x = g(f(x))$, and we may differentiate to find that\n$1 = g'(f(x)) f'(x) = g'(f(x)) f(f(x))$. It follows that $g'(y) = 1/f(y)$ for $y \\geq y_0$;\nsince $g$ takes arbitrarily large values, the integral $\\int_{y_0}^\\infty dy/f(y)$ must diverge.\nOne then gets a contradiction from any reasonable lower bound on $f(y)$ for $y$ large,\ne.g., the bound $f(x) \\geq \\alpha x^2$ from the second solution. (One can also\nstart with a linear lower bound $f(x) \\geq \\beta x$, then use the integral expression for $g$\nto deduce that $g(x) \\leq \\gamma \\log x$, which in turn forces $f(x)$ to grow exponentially.)", "category": "Algebra", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2010}

If this claim is proven, then we can start with $\\NN \\setminus \\{1,2,3,5,\\dots\\}$, which is a sandwiched set, and repeatedly perform this partition, which will eventually sort each natural number into a Fibonacci-type sequence.\n\nLet $S$ be a sandwiched set given by $\\{a_i\\}_{i=0}^{\\infty}, \\{b_i\\}_{i=0}^{\\infty}$, so the smallest element in $S$ is $x = a_0 + 1$. Note that $y = a_1+1$ is also in $S$ and $x < y$. Then consider the Fibonacci-type sequence given by $f_0 = x, f_1 = y$, and $f_{k+2} = f_{k+1} + f_k$. We can then see that $f_i \\in [a_i+1,b_i-1]$, as the sum of numbers in the intervals $[a_{k}+1,b_{k}-1]$, $[a_{k+1}+1,b_{k+1}-1]$ lies in the interval \\[[a_{k} + a_{k+1} + 2,b_k + b_{k+1}-2] = [a_{k+2}+2,b_{k+2}-2] \\subset [a_{k+2}+1,b_{k+2}-1].\\]\n\nTherefore, this gives a natural partition of $S$ into this sequence and two sets: \\begin{align*} S_1 &= \\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\infty} [a_i+1,f_i-1] \\\\ \\text{and} \\,\\, S_2 &= \\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\infty} [f_i+1,b_i-1].\\end{align*} (For convenience, $[x,x-1]$ will be treated as the empty set.)\n\nWe now show that $S_1$ and $S_2$ are sandwiched. Since $\\{a_i\\}$, $\\{f_i\\}$, and $\\{b_i\\}$ satisfy the Fibonacci recurrence, it is enough to check that the intervals have nondecreasing lengths. For $S_1$, that is equivalent to $f_{k+1} - a_{k+1} \\ge f_k - a_k$ for each $k$. Fortunately, for $k \\ge 1$, the difference is $f_{k-1} - a_{k-1} \\ge 0$, and for $k = 0$, $f_1 - a_1 = 1 = f_0 - a_0$. Similarly for $S_2$, checking $b_{k+1} - f_{k+1} \\ge b_k - f_k$ is easy for $k \\ge 1$ as $b_{k-1} - f_{k-1} \\ge 0$, and \\[(b_{1} - f_1) - (b_0 - f_0) = (b_1 - a_1) - (b_0 - a_0),\\] which is nonnegative since the lengths of intervals in $S$ are nondecreasing.\n\nTherefore we have shown that $S_1$ and $S_2$ are sandwiched. (Note that some of the $[a_i+1,f_i-1]$ may be empty, which would shift some indices back.) Since this gives us a procedure to take a set $S$ and produce a Fibonacci-type sequence with its smallest element, along which two other sandwiched types, we can partition $\\NN$ into an infinite number of Fibonacci-type sequences.\n\n\\paragraph{Third solution.} We add Fibonacci-type sequences one-by-one. At each step, let $x$ be the smallest number that has not been used in any previous sequence. We generate a new Fibonacci-type sequence as follows. Set $a_0 = x$ and for $i \\ge 1$, set \\[a_i = \\left \\lfloor \\varphi a_{i-1} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor.\\] Equivalently, $a_{i}$ is the closest integer to $\\varphi a_{i-1}$. \\\\\nIt suffices to show that this sequence is Fibonacci-type and that no two sequences generated in this way overlap.\nWe first show that for a positive integer $n$, \\[\\left \\lfloor \\varphi \\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor = n + \\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor . \\]\nIndeed, \\begin{align*} \\left \\lfloor \\varphi \\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor &= \\left \\lfloor (1 + \\varphi^{-1}) \\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\frac{1}{2}\\right \\rfloor \\\\\n&= \\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\varphi^{-1} \\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right \\rfloor + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor.\n\\end{align*}\nNote that $\\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor = \\varphi n + c$ for some $|c| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$; this implies that $\\varphi^{-1}\\left \\lfloor \\varphi n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor$ is within $\\varphi^{-1}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{1}{2}$ of $n$, so its closest integer is $n$, proving the claim.\n\nTherefore these sequences are Fibonacci-type. Additionally, if $a \\neq b$, then $|\\varphi a - \\varphi b| \\ge \\varphi > 1$. Then \\[a \\neq b \\implies \\left \\lfloor \\varphi a + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\neq \\left \\lfloor \\varphi b + \\frac{1}{2} \\right \\rfloor,\\]\nand since the first term of each sequence is chosen to not overlap with any previous sequences, these sequences are disjoint.\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  Ankan Bhattacharya points out that the same sequence\n  essentially appears in IMO 1993, Problem 5 --- in other words,\n  a strictly increasing function $f \\colon \\ZZ_{>0} \\to \\ZZ_{>0}$ with $f(1) = 2$,\n  and $f(f(n)) = f(n) + n$.\n\n  Nikolai Beluhov sent us an older reference from March 1977,\n  where Martin Gardner wrote in his column about Wythoff's Nim.\n  The relevant excerpt goes:\n  \\begin{quote}\n    ``Imagine that we go through the infinite sequence of safe pairs (in\n    the manner of Eratosthenes' sieve for sifting out primes) and cross\n    out the infinite set of all safe pairs that are pairs in the Fibonacci\n    sequence. The smallest pair that is not crossed out is 4/7. We can now\n    cross out a second infinite set of safe pairs, starting with 4/7, that\n    are pairs in the Lucas sequence. An infinite number of safe pairs, of\n    which the lowest is now 6/10, remain. This pair too begins another\n    infinite Fibonacci sequence, all of whose pairs are safe. The process\n    continues forever. Robert Silber, a mathematician at North Carolina\n    State University, calls a safe pair ``primitive'' if it is the first\n    safe pair that generates a Fibonacci sequence.''\n  \\end{quote}\n  The relevant article by Robert Silber is\n  \\emph{A Fibonacci Property of Wythoff Pairs},\n  from The Fibonacci Quarterly 11/1976.\n\\end{remark*}\n\n\n\\paragraph{Fourth solution (Mark Sellke).}\nFor later reference let \\[ f_1=0, f_2=1, f_3=1, \\dots \\]\ndenote the ordinary Fibonacci numbers.\nWe will denote the Fibonacci-like sequences by $F^i$ and the elements with subscripts;\nhence $F^2_1$ is the first element of the second sequence.\nOur construction amounts to just iteratively add new sequences;\nhence the following claim is the whole problem.\n\n\\begin{lemma*}\n  For any disjoint collection of Fibonacci-like sequences\n  $F^1,\\dots,F^k$ and any integer $m$ contained in none of them,\n  there is a new Fibonacci-like sequence $F^{k+1}$ beginning\n  with $F^{k+1}_1=m$ which is disjoint from the previous sequences.\n\\end{lemma*}\n\nObserve first that for each sequence $F^j$ there is $c^j\\in \\RR^n$ such that\n\\[ F^j_n=c^j\\phi^n+o(1)  \\]\nwhere \\[\\phi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]\n\nCollapse the group $(\\RR^+,\\times)$ into the half-open interval\n$J = \\left\\{ x \\mid 1 \\le x < \\phi \\right\\}$\nby defining $T(x)=y$ for the unique $y\\in J$ with $x=y\\phi^n$ for some integer $n$.\n\nFix an interval $I=[a,b]\\subseteq [1.2,1.3]$ (the last condition is to\navoid wrap-around issues) which contains none of the $c^j$, and take\n$\\varepsilon<0.001$ to be small enough that in fact each $c^j$ has\ndistance at least $10\\varepsilon$ from $I$; this means any $c_j$ and\nelement of $I$ differ by at least a $(1+10\\varepsilon)$ factor. The idea\nwill be to take $F^{k+1}_1=m$ and $F^{k+1}_2$ to be a large such that\nthe induced values of $F^{k+1}_j$ grow like $k\\phi^j$ for $j\\in\nT^{-1}(I)$, so that $F^{k+1}_n$ is separated from the $c^j$ after\napplying $T$. What's left to check is the convergence.\n\nNow let \\[c=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{f_n}{\\phi^n}\\] and take\n$M$ large enough that for $n>M$ we have\n\\[\\left|\\frac{f_n}{c\\phi^n}-1\\right|<\\varepsilon.\\]\n\nNow $\\frac{T^{-1}(I)}{c}$ contains arbitrarily large integers,\nso there are infinitely many $N$ with $cN\\in T^{-1}(I)$ with $N>\\frac{10m}{\\varepsilon}$.\nWe claim that for any such $N$, the sequence $F^{(N)}$ defined by\n\\[F^{(N)}_1=m,F^{(N)}_2=N\\] will be very multiplicatively similar to the\nnormal Fibonacci numbers up to rescaling;\nindeed for $j=2,j=3$ we have $\\frac{F_2^{(N)}}{f_2}=N,\\frac{F_3^{(N)}}{f_3}=N+m$\nand so by induction we will have\n\\[ \\frac{F^{(N)}_j}{f_j} \\in [N,N+m] \\subseteq [N,N(1+\\varepsilon)] \\]\nfor $j\\geq 2$.\nTherefore, up to small multiplicative errors, we have\n\\[F_j^{(N)}\\approx Nf_j\\approx cN\\phi^j.\\]\nFrom this we see that for $j>M$ we have\n\\[T(F_j^{(N)})\\in  T(cN)\\cdot [1-2\\varepsilon,1+2\\varepsilon].\\]\nIn particular, since $T(cN)\\in I$ and $I$ is separated from each $c_j$\nby a factor of $(1+10\\varepsilon)$,\nwe get that $F_j^{(N)}$ is not in any of $F^1,F^2,\\dots,F^k$.\n\nFinishing is easy, since we now have a uniform estimate on how many\nterms we need to check for a new element before the exponential growth\ntakes over. We will just use pigeonhole to argue that there are few\npossible collisions among those early terms, so we can easily pick a\nvalue of $N$ which avoids them all. We write it out below.\n\nFor large $L$, the set \\[S_L=(I\\cdot \\phi^L)\\cap\\ZZ\\] contains at\nleast $k_I\\phi^L$ elements. As $N$ ranges over $S_L$, for each fixed\n$j$, the value of $F^{(N)}_j$ varies by at most a factor of $1.1$\nbecause we imposed $I\\subseteq [1.2,1.3]$ and so this is true for the\nfirst two terms, hence for all subsequent terms by induction. Now\nsuppose $L$ is very large, and consider a fixed pair $(i,j)$ with $i\\leq\nk$ and $j\\leq M$. We claim there is at most $1$ possible value $k$ such\nthat the term $F^i_k$ could equal $F^{(N)}_j$ for some $N\\in S_L$;\nindeed, the terms of $F^i$ are growing at exponential rate with factor\n$\\phi>1.1$, so at most one will be in a given interval of multiplicative\nwidth at most $1.1$.\n\nHence, of these $k_I\\phi^L$ values of $N$, at most $kM$ could cause\nproblems, one for each pair $(i,j)$. However by monotonicity of\n$F^{(N)}_j$ in $N$, at most $1$ value of $N$ causes a collision for each\npair $(i,j)$. Hence for large $L$ so that $k_I\\phi^L>10kM$ we can find a\nsuitable $N\\in S_L$ by pigeonhole and the sequence $F^{(N)}$ defined by\n$(m,N,N+m,\\dots)$ works.\n\\pagebreak\n\n\n\\end{document}", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "TSTST", "year": 2017}

Two of these are $P_1$ and $P_2$,\nand any point of tangency counts for two more. However, off of $L$,\nany point of tangency would have a mirror image which is also a point of\ntangency, and there cannot be six solutions. Hence we have now found all\npossible $\\alpha$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nFor any nonzero value of $\\alpha$, the two\nconics will intersect in four points in the complex projective plane\n$\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. To determine the\n$y$-coordinates of these intersection points, subtract the two equations\nto obtain\n\\[\n(y-x) = \\alpha(x-y)(x+y) + \\alpha(x-y).\n\\]\nTherefore, at\na point of intersection we have either $x=y$, or $x = -1/\\alpha - (y+1)$.\nSubstituting these two possible linear conditions into the second\nequation shows that the $y$-coordinate of a point of intersection is a\nroot of either\n$Q_1(y) = \\alpha y^2+(\\alpha-1)y + 1/24$ or\n$Q_2(y) = \\alpha y^2 + (\\alpha+1) y + 25/24 +1/\\alpha$.\n\nIf two curves\nare tangent, then the $y$-coordinates of at least two of the\nintersection points will coincide; the converse is also true because one of the\ncurves is the graph of a function in $x$. The coincidence\noccurs precisely when either\nthe discriminant of at least one of $Q_1$ or $Q_2$ is zero, or\nthere is a common root of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Computing the discriminants of $Q_1$\nand $Q_2$ yields (up to constant factors) $f_1(\\alpha)=6\\alpha^2 -\n13\\alpha + 6$ and $f_2(\\alpha)=6\\alpha^2 - 13\\alpha - 18$, respectively.\nIf on the other hand $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ have a common root, it must\nbe also a root of $Q_2(y) - Q_1(y) = 2y +1 + 1/\\alpha$,\nyielding $y = -(1+\\alpha)/(2\\alpha)$ and\n$0 = Q_1(y) = -f_2(\\alpha)/(24 \\alpha)$.\n\nThus the values of\n$\\alpha$ for which the two curves are tangent must be contained in the\nset of zeros of $f_1$ and $f_2$, namely $2/3$, $3/2$, and\n$(13\\pm\\sqrt{601})/12$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThe fact that the two conics in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\CC)$ meet in four points, counted\nwith multiplicities, is a special case of \\emph{B\\'ezout's theorem}: two\ncurves in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\CC)$ of degrees $m, n$ and not sharing any common component\nmeet in exactly $mn$ points when counted with multiplicity.\n\nMany solvers were surprised that the proposers chose the parameter $1/24$\nto give two rational roots and two nonrational roots. In fact, they had\nno choice in the matter: attempting to make all four roots rational\nby replacing $1/24$ by $\\beta$ amounts\nto asking for $\\beta^2 + \\beta$ and $\\beta^2 + \\beta + 1$ to be perfect\nsquares.

(Thanks to Noam Elkies for providing this\ncomputation.)\n\nHowever, there are choices that make the radical milder,\ne.g., $\\beta = 1/3$  gives\n$\\beta^2 + \\beta = 4/9$ and $\\beta^2 + \\beta + 1 = 13/9$,\nwhile $\\beta = 3/5$ gives $\\beta^2 + \\beta = 24/25$\nand $\\beta^2 + \\beta + 1 = 49/25$.", "category": "Geometry", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2007}

exactly $k$ $B$-inversions.\n\\end{mdframed}\nThe following solution was posted by Michael Ren,\nand I think it is the most natural one\n(since it captures all the combinatorial ideas\nusing a $q$-generating function that is easier to think about,\nand thus makes the problem essentially a long computation).\n\nDenote by $M$ our multiset of $n$ positive integers.\nDefine an \\emph{inversion} of a permutation to be pair $i < j$\nwith $w_i < w_j$ (which is a $(0,\\dots,0)$-inversion in the problem statement);\nthis is the usual definition\n(see \\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(discrete_mathematics)}).\nSo we want to show the number of $A$-inversions\nis equal to the number of usual inversions.\nIn what follows we count permutations on $M$ with multiplicity:\nso $M = \\{1,1,2\\}$ still has $3!=6$ permutations.\n\nWe are going to do what is essentially recursion,\nbut using generating functions in a variable $q$ to do our book-keeping.\n(Motivation: there's no good closed form for the number of inversions,\nbut there's a great generating function known --- which is even better\nfor us, since we're only trying to show two numbers are equal!)\nFirst, we prove two claims.\n\n\\begin{claim*}\n  For any positive integer $n$,\n  the generating function for the number of permutations\n  of $(1, 2, \\dots, n)$ with exactly $k$ inversions is\n  \\[ n!_q \\coloneq 1 \\cdot (1+q) \\cdot (1+q+q^2) \\cdot \\dots (1+q+\\dots+q^{n-1}). \\]\n\\end{claim*}\nHere we mean that the coefficient of $q^s$ above\ngives the number of permutations with exactly $s$ inversions.\n\\begin{proof}\n  This is an induction on $n$, with $n=1$ being trivial.\n  Suppose we choose the first element to be $i$, with $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n  Then there will always be exactly $i-1$ inversions\n  using the first element,\n  so this contributes $q^i \\cdot (n-1)!_q$.\n  Summing $1 \\le i \\le n$ gives the result.\n\\end{proof}\nUnfortunately, the main difficulty of the problem\nis that there are repeated elements,\nwhich makes our notation much more horrific.\n\nLet us define the following.\nWe take our given multiset $M$ of $n$ positive integers,\nwe suppose the distinct numbers are\n$\\theta_1 < \\theta_2 < \\dots < \\theta_m$.\nWe let $e_i$ be the number of times $\\theta_i$ appears.\nTherefore the multiplicities $e_i$ should have sums\n\\[ e_1 + \\dots + e_m = n \\]\nand $m$ denotes the number of distinct elements.\nFinally, we let\n\\[ F(e_1, \\dots, e_m)\n  = \\sum_{\\text{permutations } \\sigma}\n  q^{\\text{number inversions of } \\sigma} \\]\nbe the associated generating function for the number of inversions.\nFor example, the first claim we proved says that $F(1, \\dots, 1) = n!_q$.\n\n\\begin{claim*}\n  We have the explicit formula\n  \\[ F(e_1, \\dots, e_m) = n!_q \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^m \\frac{e_i!}{e_i!_q}. \\]\n\\end{claim*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  First suppose we perturb all the elements slightly,\n  so that they are no longer equal.\n  Then the generating function would just be $n!_q$.\n\n  Then, we undo the perturbations for each group,\n  one at a time, and claim that we get the above $e_i!_q$ factor each time.\n  Indeed, put the permutations into classes of $e_1!$ each\n  where permutations in the same classes differ\n  only in the order of the perturbed $\\theta_1$'s\n  (with the other $n-e_1$ elements being fixed).\n  Then there is a factor of $e_1!_q$ from each class,\n  owing to the slightly perturbed inversions we added within each class.\n  So we remove that factor and add $e_1! \\cdot q^0$ instead.\n  This accounts for the first term of the product.\n\n  Repeating this now with each term of the product implies the claim.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThus we have the formula for the number of inversions in general.\nWe wish to show this also equals the generating function\nthe number of $A$-inversions, for any fixed choice of $A$.\nThis will be an induction by $n$, with the base case being immediate.\n\nFor the inductive step, fix $A$,\nand assume the first element satisfies\n$\\theta_k \\le a_1 < \\theta_{k+1}$ (so $0 \\le k \\le m$;\nwe for convenience set $\\theta_0 = -\\infty$ and $\\theta_m = +\\infty$).\nWe count the permutations based on what the first element\n$\\theta_i$ of the permutation is.\nThen:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\ii Consider permutations starting with\n  $\\theta_i \\in \\left\\{ \\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_k \\right\\}$.\n  Then the number of inversions which will\n  use this first term is $(e_1 + \\dots + e_{i-1})\n  + (e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_m)$.\n  Also, there are $e_i$ ways to pick which\n  $\\theta_i$ gets used as the first term.\n  So we get a contribution of\n  \\[ q^{e_1 + \\dots + e_{i-1} + (e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_m)}\n    \\cdot e_i \\cdot F(e_1, \\dots, e_i-1, \\dots, e_m) \\]\n  in this case\n  (with inductive hypothesis to get the last $F$-term).\n\n  \\ii Now suppose $\\theta_i \\in \\left\\{ \\theta_{k+1}, \\dots, \\theta_m \\right\\}$.\n  Then the number of inversions which will\n  use this first term is $e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_{i-1}$.\n  Thus by a similar argument the contribution is\n  \\[ q^{e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_{i-1}}\n    \\cdot e_i \\cdot F(e_1, \\dots, e_i-1, \\dots, e_m). \\]\n\\end{itemize}\nTherefore, to complete the problem it suffices to prove\n\\begin{align*}\n  &\\phantom+ \\sum_{i=1}^k q^{(e_1 + \\dots + e_{i-1}) + (e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_m)}\n    \\cdot e_i \\cdot F(e_1, \\dots, e_i-1, \\dots, e_m) \\\\\n  &+ \\sum_{i=k+1}^m q^{e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_{i-1}}\n    \\cdot e_i \\cdot F(e_1, \\dots, e_i-1, \\dots, e_m) \\\\\n  &= F(e_1, \\dots, e_m).\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we see that\n\\[ \\frac{e_i \\cdot F(e_1, \\dots, e_i-1, \\dots, e_m)}{F(e_1, \\dots, e_m)}\n  = \\frac{1+\\dots+q^{e_i-1}}{1+q+\\dots+q^{n-1}}\n  = \\frac{1-q^{e_i}}{1-q^n} \\]\nso it's equivalent to show\n\\[ 1-q^n\n  = q^{e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_m} \\sum_{i=1}^k q^{e_1 + \\dots + e_{i-1}}(1-q^{e_i})\n  + \\sum_{i=k+1}^m q^{e_{k+1} + \\dots + e_{i-1}} (1-q^{e_i})\n\\]\nwhich is clear,\nsince the left summand telescopes to\n$q^{e_{k+1}+\\dots+e_m} - q^n$\nand the right summand telescopes to\n$1 - q^{e_{k+1}+\\dots+e_m}$.\n\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  Technically, we could have skipped straight to the induction,\n  without proving the first two claims.\n  However I think the solution reads more naturally this way.\n\\end{remark*}\n\\pagebreak", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "USAMO", "year": 2017}

The punctured torus $T \\setminus \\{p\\}$ deformation retracts onto the union of the loops $g$ and $h$, and so $\\pi_1(T\\setminus\\{p\\})$, the fundamental group of $T\\setminus\\{p\\}$ based at $(0,0)$, is the free group on two generators, $\\langle g,h\\rangle$.\n\nLet $\\gamma$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ denote the following loops based at $(0,0)$ in $T$: $\\gamma$ is the image of the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(n,m)$ under the projection $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T$, and $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is the image of the lattice walk from $(0,0)$ to $(n,m)$, staying just below the line $y=mx/n$, that was described in the first solution. There is a straight-line homotopy with fixed endpoints between the two paths in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ from $(0,0)$ to $(n,m)$, the line segment and the lattice walk, and this homotopy does not pass through any point of the form $(a+\\epsilon,b-\\epsilon)$ for $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ by the construction of the lattice walk. It follows that $\\gamma$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ are homotopic loops in $T \\setminus \\{p\\}$. Since the class of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $\\pi_1(T\\setminus\\{p\\})$ is evidently $gh^{a_1}gh^{a_2}\\cdots gh^{a_n}$, it follows that the class of $\\gamma$ in $\\pi_1(T\\setminus\\{p\\})$ is the same.\n\nNow since $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, there is an element $\\phi \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ sending $(n,m)$ to $(1,0)$, which then sends the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(n,m)$ to the segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$. Then $\\phi$ induces a homeomorphism of $T$ sending $\\gamma$ to $g$, which in turn induces an isomorphism $\\phi_* :\\thinspace \\pi_1(T\\setminus \\{p\\}) \\to \\pi_1(T\\setminus \\{\\phi^{-1}(p)\\})$. Both fundamental groups are equal to $\\langle g,h\\rangle$, and we conclude that $\\phi_*$ sends $gh^{a_1}gh^{a_2}\\cdots gh^{a_n}$ to $g$.

To prove the claim for  $n \\geq 2$, write\n\\begin{align*}\n|x_{n+1}| &= |2x_nx_{n-1}-x_{n-2}| \\\\\n&\\geq 2|x_n||x_{n-1}|-|x_{n-2}| \\\\\n&\\geq |x_n|(2|x_{n-1}|-1) \\geq |x_n|,\n\\end{align*} \nwhere the last step follows from $|x_{n-1}| \\geq |x_{n-2}| \\geq \\cdots \\geq |x_0| = 1$.\n\nWe may thus assume hereafter that $|a|\\leq 1$. We can then write $a = \\cos b$ for some $b \\in [0,\\pi]$. \nLet $\\{F_n\\}$ be the Fibonacci sequence, defined as usual by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$. We show by induction that\n\\[\nx_n = \\cos(F_n b) \\qquad (n \\geq 0).\n\\]\nIndeed, this is true for $n=0,1,2$; given that it is true for $n \\leq m$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n2x_mx_{m-1}&=2\\cos(F_mb)\\cos(F_{m-1}b) \\\\\n&= \\cos((F_m-F_{m-1})b)+\\cos((F_m+F_{m-1})b) \\\\\n&= \\cos(F_{m-2}b)+\\cos(F_{m+1}b)\n\\end{align*}\nand so \n$x_{m+1} = 2x_mx_{m-1}-x_{m-2} = \\cos(F_{m+1}b)$. This completes the induction.\n\n\nSince $x_n = \\cos(F_n b)$, if $x_n=0$ for some $n$ then $F_n b = \\frac{k}{2} \\pi$ for some odd integer $k$. In particular, we can write $b = \\frac{c}{d}(2\\pi)$ where $c = k$ and $d = 4F_n$ are integers.\n\n\nLet $x_n$ denote the pair $(F_n,F_{n+1})$, where each entry in this pair is viewed as an element of $\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z}$. Since there are only finitely many possibilities for $x_n$, there must be some $n_2>n_1$ such that $x_{n_1}=x_{n_2}$. Now $x_n$ uniquely determines both $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n-1}$, and it follows that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is periodic: for $\\ell = n_2-n_1$, $x_{n+\\ell} = x_n$ for all $n \\geq 0$. In particular, $F_{n+\\ell} \\equiv F_n \\pmod{d}$ for all $n$. But then $\\frac{F_{n+\\ell}c}{d}-\\frac{F_n c}{d}$ is an integer, and so\n\\begin{align*}\nx_{n+\\ell} &= \\cos\\left(\\frac{F_{n+\\ell}c}{d}(2\\pi)\\right)\\\\\n& = \\cos\\left(\\frac{F_n c}{d}(2\\pi)\\right) = x_n\n\\end{align*}\nfor all $n$.

The resulting string of symbols consists of one star at the beginning, 2017 bar-star combinations, and 3860-2018 more stars.\n\nUsing a computer, it is practical to compute the exact cardinality of $S$ by finding the coefficient of $x^{3860}$ in\n$(x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^6 + x^{10})^{2018}$.

questions,\nBob can rule out some number in $\\{1, \\dots, 2^k+1\\}$\nform being equal to $x$.\n\\end{claim*}\n\\begin{proof}\n  First, Bob asks the question $S_0 = \\{ 2^k+1 \\}$\n  until Alice answers ``yes''\n  or until Bob has asked $k+1$ questions.\n  If Alice answers ``no'' to all of these then Bob rules out $2^k+1$.\n  So let's assume Alice just said ``yes''.\n\n  Now let $T = \\{1, \\dots, 2^k\\}$.\n  Then, he asks $k$-follow up questions $S_1$, \\dots, $S_k$\n  defined as follows:\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\ii $S_1 = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\dots, 2^k-1\\}$ consists of all numbers\n    in $T$ whose least significant digit in binary is $1$.\n    \\ii $S_2 = \\{ 2, 3, 6, 7, \\dots, 2^k-2, 2^k-1\\}$\n    consists of all numbers in $T$ whose second least\n    significant digit in binary is $1$.\n    \\ii More generally $S_i$\n    consists of all numbers in $T$ whose $i$th least\n    significant digit in binary is $1$.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  WLOG Alice answers these all as ``yes'' (the other cases are similar).\n  Among the last $k+1$ answers at least one must be truthful,\n  and the number $2^k$ (having zeros in all relevant digits)\n  does not appear in any of $S_0$, \\dots, $S_k$ and is ruled out.\n\\end{proof}\nThus in this way Bob can repeatedly find non-possibilities for $x$\n(and then relabel the remaining candidates $1$, \\dots, $N-1$)\nuntil he arrives at a set of at most $2^k$ numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Part (b)}:\nIt suffices to consider $n = \\left\\lceil 1.99^k \\right\\rceil$\nand $N = n+1$ for large $k$.\nAt the $t$th step, Bob asks some question $S_t$;\nwe phrase each of Alice's answers in the form ``$x \\notin B_t$'',\nwhere $B_t$ is either $S_t$ or its complement.\n(You may think of these as ``bad sets'';\nthe idea is to show we can avoid having any number\nappear in $k+1$ consecutive bad sets,\npreventing Bob from ruling out any numbers.)\n\nMain idea: for every number $1 \\le x \\le N$,\nat time step $t$ we define its \\emph{weight}\nto be \\[ w(x) = 1.998^e \\]\nwhere $e$ is the largest number\nsuch that $x \\in B_{t-1} \\cap B_{t-2} \\cap \\dots \\cap B_{t-e}$.\n\n\\begin{claim*}\n  Alice can ensure the total weight never exceeds $1.998^{k+1}$\n  for large $k$.\n\\end{claim*}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n  Let $W_{t}$ denote the sum of weights after the $t$th question.\n  We have $W_0 = N < 1000n$.\n  We will prove inductively that $W_t < 1000n$ always.\n\n  At time $t$, Bob specifies a question $S_t$.\n  We have Alice choose $B_t$ as whichever of $S_t$ or $\\ol{S_t}$\n  has lesser total weight, hence at most $W_t/2$.\n  The weights of for $B_t$ increase by a factor of $1.998$,\n  while the weights for $\\ol{B_t}$ all reset to $1$.\n  So the new total weight after time $t$ is\n  \\[ W_{t+1} \\le 1.998 \\cdot \\frac{W_t}{2}\n    + \\# \\ol{B_t} \\le 0.999 W_t + n. \\]\n  Thus if $W_t < 1000n$ then $W_{t+1} < 1000n$.\n\n  To finish, note that\n  $1000n < 1000 \\left( 1.99^k + 1 \\right) < 1.998^{k+1}$\n  for $k$ large.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn particular, no individual number can have weight $1.998^{k+1}$.\nThus for every time step $t$ we have\n\\[ B_t \\cap B_{t+1} \\cap \\dots \\cap B_{t+k} = \\varnothing. \\]\nThen once Bob stops, if he declares a set of $n$ positive integers,\nand $x$ is an integer Bob did not choose,\nthen Alice's question history is consistent with $x$ being Alice's number,\nas among any $k+1$ consecutive answers\nshe claimed that $x \\in \\ol{B_t}$ for some $t$ in that range.\n\n\\begin{remark*}\n  [Motivation]\n  In our $B_t$ setup, let's think backwards.\n  The problem is equivalent to avoiding $e = k+1$ at any time step $t$,\n  for any number $x$.\n  That means\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\ii have at most two elements with $e = k$ at time $t-1$,\n    \\ii thus have at most four elements with $e = k-1$ at time $t-2$,\n    \\ii thus have at most eight elements with $e = k-2$ at time $t-3$,\n    \\ii and so on.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  We already exploited this in solving part (a).\n  In any case it's now natural to try letting $w(x) = 2^e$,\n  so that all the cases above sum to ``equally bad'' situations:\n  since $8 \\cdot 2^{k-2} = 4 \\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2 \\cdot 2^k$, say.\n\n  However, we then get $W_{t+1} \\le \\half (2W_t) + n$,\n  which can increase without bound due to contributions\n  from numbers resetting to zero.\n  The way to fix this is to change the

Moreover,\nthe last number in the sequence can never decrease, because it is always\nreplaced by its least common multiple with another number.\nSince it is bounded above (by the product\nof all of the numbers), the last number must eventually reach its\nmaximum value, after which it remains constant throughout. After this\nhappens, the next-to-last number will never decrease, so it eventually\nbecomes constant, and so on. After finitely many steps, all of the numbers\nwill achieve their final values, so\nno more steps will be possible. This only happens when\n$a_j$ divides $a_k$ for all pairs $j < k$.\n\nWe next check that there is only one possible final sequence.\nFor $p$ a prime and $m$ a nonnegative integer, we claim that the number\nof integers in the list divisible by $p^m$ never changes. To see this,\nsuppose we replace $a_j, a_k$ by $\\gcd(a_j, a_k),\\lcm(a_j,a_k)$.\nIf neither of $a_j, a_k$ is divisible by $p^m$, then neither of\n$\\gcd(a_j, a_k),\\lcm(a_j,a_k)$ is either.\nIf exactly one $a_j, a_k$ is divisible by $p^m$, then\n$\\lcm(a_j,a_k)$ is divisible by $p^m$ but $\\gcd(a_j, a_k)$ is not.\n\n$\\gcd(a_j, a_k),\\lcm(a_j,a_k)$ are as well.\n\nIf we started out with exactly $h$ numbers not divisible by $p^m$,\nthen in the final sequence $a'_1, \\dots, a'_n$, the numbers\n$a'_{h+1}, \\dots, a'_n$ are divisible by $p^m$ while the numbers\n$a'_1, \\dots, a'_h$ are not. Repeating this argument for each\npair $(p,m)$ such that $p^m$ divides the initial product\n$a_1,\\dots,a_n$, we can determine the exact prime factorization\nof each of $a'_1,\\dots,a'_n$. This proves that the final sequence\nis unique.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\n(by David Savitt and Noam Elkies)\nHere are two other ways to prove the termination.\nOne is to observe that $\\prod_j a_j^j$\nis \\emph{strictly} increasing at each step, and bounded above by\n$(a_1\\cdots a_n)^n$. The other is to notice that $a_1$ is nonincreasing\nbut always positive, so eventually becomes constant; then\n$a_2$ is nonincreasing but always positive, and so on.\n\n\\textbf{Reinterpretation:}\nFor each $p$, consider the sequence consisting of the\nexponents of $p$ in the prime factorizations of $a_1,\\dots,a_n$.\nAt each step, we pick two positions $i$ and $j$ such that the exponents\nof some prime $p$ are in the wrong order at positions $i$ and $j$.\nWe then sort these two position into the correct order for every prime $p$\nsimultaneously.\n\nIt is clear that this can only terminate with all sequences being sorted\ninto the correct order. We must still check that the process terminates;\nhowever, since all but finitely many of the exponent\nsequences consist of all zeroes,\nand each step makes a nontrivial switch in at least one of the other exponent\nsequences, it is enough to check the case of a single exponent sequence.\nThis can be done as in the first solution.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nAbhinav Kumar suggests the following proof that the process always terminates\nin at most  $\\binom{n}{2}$ steps.\n(This is a variant of the worst-case analysis of the \\emph{bubble sort}\nalgorithm.)\n\nConsider the number of pairs $(k,l)$\nwith $1 \\leq k < l \\leq n$ such that $a_k$ does not divide $a_l$\n(call these \\emph{bad pairs}).\nAt each step, we find one bad pair $(i,j)$ and eliminate it, and we do not\ntouch any pairs that do not involve either $i$ or $j$.\nIf $i < k < j$, then neither of the pairs $(i,k)$ and $(k,j)$ can become\nbad,\nbecause $a_i$ is replaced by a divisor of itself, while $a_j$ is replaced by\na multiple of itself. If $k < i$, then $(k,i)$ can only become a bad pair if\n$a_k$ divided $a_i$ but not $a_j$, in which case $(k,j)$ stops being bad.\nSimilarly, if $k > j$, then $(i,k)$ and $(j,k)$\neither stay the same or switch status. Hence the number of bad pairs\ngoes down by at least 1 each time; since it is at most $\\binom{n}{2}$\nto begin with, this is an upper bound for the number of steps.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThis problem is closely related to the classification theorem for\nfinite abelian groups. Namely, if $a_1,\\dots,a_n$\nand $a'_1,\\dots,a'_n$ are the sequences obtained at two different\nsteps in the process, then the abelian groups\n$\\ZZ/a_1 \\ZZ \\times \\cdots \\times \\ZZ/a_n \\ZZ$\nand\n$\\ZZ/a'_1 \\ZZ \\times \\cdots \\times \\ZZ/a'_n \\ZZ$\nare isomorphic. The final sequence gives a canonical\npresentation of this group; the terms of this sequence are called the\n\\emph{elementary divisors} or \\emph{invariant factors} of the group.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:} (by Tom Belulovich)\nA \\emph{lattice} is a partially ordered set $L$ in which for\nany two $x,y \\in L$, there is a unique minimal element $z$ with $z \\geq\nx$ and $z \\geq y$, called the \\emph{join} and denoted $x \\wedge y$,\nand there is a unique maximal element $z$ with $z \\leq x$ and $z \\leq y$,\ncalled the \\emph{meet} and denoted $x \\vee y$. In terms of a lattice $L$,\none can pose the following generalization of the given problem.\nStart with $a_1,\\dots,a_n \\in L$. If $i < j$ but $a_i \\not\\leq a_j$,\nit is permitted to replace $a_i, a_j$ by $a_i \\vee a_j, a_i \\wedge a_j$,\nrespectively. The same argument as above shows that this always terminates\nin at most $\\binom{n}{2}$ steps. The question is, under what conditions on\nthe lattice $L$ is the final sequence uniquely determined by the initial\nsequence?\n\nIt turns out that this holds if and only if $L$ is \\emph{distributive},\ni.e., for any $x,y,z \\in L$,\n\\[\nx \\wedge (y \\vee z)\n= (x \\wedge y) \\vee (x \\wedge z).\n\\]\n(This is equivalent to the same axiom with the operations interchanged.)\nFor example, if $L$ is a \\emph{Boolean algebra}, i.e., the set of subsets\nof a given set $S$ under inclusion, then $\\wedge$ is union, $\\vee$\nis intersection, and the distributive law holds.\nConversely, any finite\ndistributive lattice is contained in a Boolean algebra by a theorem of\nBirkhoff. The correspondence takes each  $x \\in L$ to the set of\n$y \\in L$ such that $x \\geq y$ and $y$ cannot be written as a join\nof two elements of $L \\setminus \\{y\\}$. (See for instance\nBirkhoff, \\textit{Lattice Theory}, Amer. Math. Soc., 1967.)\n\nOn one hand, if $L$ is distributive, it can be shown that the $j$-th term\nof the final sequence is equal to the meet of $a_{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots\n\\wedge a_{i_j}$ over all sequences $1 \\leq i_1 < \\cdots < i_j \\leq n$.\nFor instance, this can be checked by forming the smallest subset $L'$\nof $L$ containing $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ and closed under meet and join,\nthen embedding $L'$ into a Boolean algebra using\nBirkhoff's theorem, then checking the claim for all Boolean algebras.\nIt can also be checked directly (as suggested by Nghi Nguyen)\nby showing that for $j=1,\\dots,n$,\nthe meet of all joins of $j$-element subsets of $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ is\ninvariant at each step.\n\nOn the other hand,\na lattice fails to be distributive if and only if\nit contains five elements $a,b,c,0,1$ such that either the only relations\namong them are implied by\n\\[\n1 \\geq a,b,c \\geq 0\n\\]\n(this lattice is sometimes called the \\emph{diamond}),\nor the only relations among them  are implied by\n\\[\n1 \\geq a \\geq b \\geq 0, \\qquad 1 \\geq c \\geq 0\n\\]\n(this lattice is sometimes called the \\emph{pentagon}).\n(For a proof, see the Birkhoff reference given above.) For each of these\nexamples, the initial sequence $a,b,c$ fails to determine the final\nsequence; for the diamond, we can end up with $0, *, 1$ for\nany of $* = a,b,c$, whereas for the pentagon we can end up with\n$0, *, 1$ for any of $* = a, b$.\n\nConsequently, the final sequence is determined by the initial sequence\nif and only if $L$ is distributive.", "category": "Number Theory", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2008}

We conclude that\n\\[\n\\det(M_{n,k}) \\equiv \\det(M_{n-2k-1,k})\n\\pmod{2},\n\\]\nproving the desired congruence.\n\nTo prove the desired result, we must now check that\n$F_{0,k}, F_{1,k}$ are odd and $F_{2,k}, \\dots, F_{2k,k}$ are even.\nFor $n=0,\\dots,k+1$, the matrix $M_{n,k}$ consists of all ones,\nso its determinant is 1 if $n=0,1$ and 0 otherwise.\n(Alternatively, we have $F_{n,k} = n!$ for $n=0,\\dots,k+1$,\nsince every permutation of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ is $k$-limited.)\nFor $n=k+2,\\dots,2k$,\nobserve that rows $k$ and $k+1$ of $M_{n,k}$  both consist of all ones,\nso $\\det(M_{n,k}) = 0$ as desired.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:} (by Tom Belulovich)\nDefine $M_{n,k}$ as in the second solution. We prove\n$\\det(M_{n,k})$ is odd for $n \\equiv 0,1 \\pmod{2k+1}$ and even otherwise,\nby directly determining whether or not $M_{n,k}$ is invertible as a matrix\nover the field of two elements.\n\nLet $r_i$ denote row $i$ of $M_{n,k}$.\nWe first check that if $n \\equiv 2, \\dots, 2k \\pmod{2k+1}$, then $M_{n,k}$\nis not invertible. In this case, we can find integers $0 \\leq a < b \\leq k$\nsuch that $n + a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2k+1}$.\nPut $j = (n+a+b)/(2k+1)$. We can then write the\nall-ones vector both as\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} r_{k+1-a + (2k+1)i}\n\\]\nand as\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} r_{k+1-b + (2k+1)i}.\n\\]\nHence $M_{n,k}$ is not invertible.\n\nWe next check that if $n \\equiv 0,1 \\pmod{2k+1}$, then $M_{n,k}$\nis invertible. Suppose that $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ are scalars such that\n$a_1 r_1 + \\cdots + a_n r_n$ is the zero vector. The $m$-th coordinate\nof this vector equals $a_{m-k} + \\cdots + a_{m+k}$, where we regard\n$a_i$ as zero if $i \\notin \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$. By comparing consecutive\ncoordinates, we obtain\n\\[\na_{m-k} = a_{m+k+1} \\qquad (1 \\leq m < n).\n\\]\nIn particular, the $a_i$ repeat with period $2k+1$.\nTaking $m=1,\\dots,k$ further yields that\n\\[\na_{k+2} = \\cdots = a_{2k+1} = 0\n\\]\nwhile taking $m=n-k, \\dots,n-1$ yields\n\\[\na_{n-2k} =  \\dots = a_{n-1-k} = 0.\n\\]\nFor $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2k+1}$, the latter can be rewritten as\n\\[\na_1 = \\cdots = a_k = 0\n\\]\nwhereas for $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2k+1}$, it can be rewritten as\n\\[\na_2 = \\cdots = a_{k+1} = 0.\n\\]\nIn either case, since we also have\n\\[\na_1 + \\cdots + a_{2k+1} = 0\n\\]\nfrom the $(k+1)$-st coordinate, we deduce that all of the $a_i$ must be\nzero, and so $M_{n,k}$ must be invertible.\n\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThe matrices $M_{n,k}$ are examples of \\emph{banded matrices},\nwhich occur frequently in numerical applications of linear algebra.\nThey are also examples of \\emph{Toeplitz matrices}.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{document}", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2008}

To see that this many are required, label the squares $(i,j)$ with $1\\leq i\\leq 2m-1$ and $1\\leq j\\leq 2n-1$, and for each square with $i,j$ both odd, color the square red; then no tile can cover more than one red square, and there are $mn$ red squares.\n\nIt remains to show that we can cover any $(2m-1) \\times (2n-1)$ rectangle with $mn$ tiles when $m,n \\geq 4$. First note that we can tile any $2 \\times (2k-1)$ rectangle with $k\\geq 3$ by $k$ tiles: one of the first type, then $k-2$ of the second type, and finally one of the first type. Thus if we can cover a $7\\times 7$ square with $16$ tiles, then we can do the general $(2m-1) \\times (2n-1)$ rectangle, by decomposing this rectangle into a $7\\times 7$ square in the lower left corner, along with $m-4$ $(2\\times 7)$ rectangles to the right of the square, and $n-4$ $((2m-1)\\times 2)$ rectangles above, and tiling each of these rectangles separately, for a total of $16+4(m-4)+m(n-4) = mn$ tiles.\n\nTo cover the $7 \\times 7$ square, note that the tiling must consist of 15 tiles of the first type and 1 of the second type, and that any $2 \\times 3$ rectangle can be covered using 2 tiles of the first type. We may thus construct a suitable covering by covering all but the center square with eight $2 \\times 3$ rectangles, in such a way that we can attach the center square to one of these rectangles to get a shape that can be covered by two tiles. An example of such a covering, with the remaining $2 \\times 3$ rectangles left intact for visual clarity, is depicted below.

It is obvious that the unique minimum is achieved by the zero polynomial, so this accounts for one of the planes.\n\nIt thus suffices to exhibit a single polynomial $P(x) \\in S$ such that the level plane of $f$ through $P$ is a supporting plane for $S$. \nThe calculation made in the solution amounts to verifying that\n\\[\nP(x) = 4x^3 - 8x^2 + 5x\n\\]\nhas this property, by interpolating between the constraints $P(1/2) \\leq 1$ and $P(1) \\leq 1$.\n\nThis still leaves the matter of correctly guessing the optimal polynomial.

Define a {\\it perfect matching} of $\\{1,\\ldots,2n\\}$ to be a permutation of $\\{1,\\ldots,2n\\}$ that is the product of $n$ disjoint transpositions. Then the Pfaffian of $M$ is given by\n\\begin{equation}\\label{pfaffeq}\n\\sum_{\\alpha} \\sgn(\\alpha) M_{i_1,j_1}\\cdots M_{i_n,j_n}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the sum is over perfect matchings $\\alpha=(i_1,j_1)\\cdots(i_n,j_n)$,\nand $\\sgn(\\alpha)$ denotes the sign of the permutation\n$\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}\n1&2&3&4&\\cdots & (2n-1)&2n \\\\\ni_1&j_1&i_2&j_2& \\cdots & i_n & j_n\n\\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$.\nThe determinant of $M$ is then the square of \\eqref{pfaffeq}, i.e.,\n\\begin{equation}\\label{deteq} \\det(M)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\sgn(\\alpha)\\sgn(\\beta) M_{i_1,j_1}\\cdots M_{i_n,j_n}M_{i'_1,j'_1}\\cdots M_{i'_n,j'_n}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the sum is now over ordered pairs $$(\\alpha=(i_1,j_1)\\cdots(i_n,j_n),\\beta=(i'_1,j'_1)\\cdots(i'_n,j'_n))$$ of perfect matchings.\n\nTaking $M = A - A^t$, so that $M_{ij} = A_{ij} - A_{ji}$,\nwe wish to find the expected value of \\eqref{deteq}; again, this is the sum of the expected values of each summand in \\eqref{deteq}. Note that each $M_{ij}$ with $i < j$ is an independent random variable taking the values $-1,0,1$ with probabilities $\\frac14,\\frac12,\\frac14$, respectively.\n\nConsider first a summand in \\eqref{deteq} with $\\alpha\\neq \\beta$. Then some factor $M_{ij}$  occurs with exponent 1; since the distribution of $M_{ij}$ is symmetric about 0, any such summand has expected value 0.\n\nConsider next a summand in \\eqref{deteq} with $\\alpha= \\beta$. This summand is a product of distinct factors of the form $M_{ij}^2$; from the distributions of the $M_{ij}$, we see that the expected value of each of these terms is $1/2^n$.\n\nSince the total number of perfect matchings $\\alpha$ is $(2n)!/(2^nn!)$, the expected value of $(\\ref{deteq})$ is therefore $(2n)!/(2^nn!)\\cdot 1/2^n=(2n)!/(4^nn!)$, as desired.", "category": "Algebra", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2016}

first $n-1$ rows are fixed.\nNow, let $N = s_n$ vary.\nNow, we prove our result by (another) induction on $N \\ge s_{n-1}$.\n\nThe base case $N = s_{n-1}$ is done by copying\nthe $n-1$st row and adding a zero at the end.\nThis is also unique,\nsince $a_{i,n} \\ge a_{i-1,n} + a_{n-1,n}$ for all $i=0, \\dots, n-2$,\nwhence $\\sum a_{i,n} \\ge s_{n-1}$ follows.\n\nNow the inductive step is based on the following lemma,\nwhich illustrates the idea of a ``unique increasable entry''.\n\\begin{lemma*}\n  Fix a stable array\n  Construct a tournament on the $n$ entries\n  of the last row as follows: for $i < j$,\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\ii $a_{i,n} \\to a_{j,n}$\n    if $a_{i,n} = a_{i,j} + a_{j,n}$, and\n    \\ii $a_{j,n} \\to a_{i,n}$\n    if $a_{i,n} = a_{i,j} + a_{j,n} + 1$.\n  \\end{itemize}\n  Then this tournament is transitive.\n  Also, except for $N = s_{n-1}$, a $0$ entry is never a source.\n\\end{lemma*}\nIntuitively, $a_{i,n} \\to a_{j,n}$\nif $a_{i,n}$ blocks $a_{j,n}$ from increasing.\nFor instance, in the example\n\\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & \\swarrow \\\\\n    4 & 1 & \\swarrow \\\\\n    5 & 3 & 1 & \\swarrow \\\\\n    \\mathbf 6 & 3 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nthe tournament is $1 \\to 3 \\to 0 \\to 6$.\n\\begin{proof}\n  [Proof of lemma]\n  Let $0 \\le i < j < k < n$ be indices.\n  Let $x = a_{i,n}$, $y = a_{j,n}$, $z = a_{k,n}$,\n  $p = a_{i,j}$, $s = a_{i,k}$, $q = a_{j,k}$.

Indeed, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 4$ and $1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 6$, we have\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^k j \\right) + (k+\\ell) + \\left(\\sum_{j=k+7}^{10} j \\right) = 34-5k+\\ell,\\]\nand for fixed $k$ this takes all values from $35-5k$ to $40-5k$ inclusive; then as $k$ ranges from $0$ to $4$, this takes all values from $15$ to $40$ inclusive.\n\nNow suppose that the scores are $a_1,\\ldots,a_{2N}$, where we order the scores so that $a_k=k$ for $k \\leq 10$ and the subsequence $a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{2N}$ is nondecreasing. For $1 \\leq k \\leq N-4$, define $S_k = \\sum_{j=k+10}^{k+N+4} a_j$. Note that for each $k$, $S_{k+1}-S_k = a_{k+N+5}-a_{k+10}$ and so $0 \\leq S_{k+1}-S_k \\leq 10$. Thus $S_1,\\ldots,S_{N-4}$ is a nondecreasing sequence of integers where each term is at most $10$ more than the previous one. On the other hand, we have \n\\begin{align*}\nS_1 + S_{N-4} &= \\sum_{j=11}^{2N} a_j \\\\\n&= (7.4)(2N)-\\sum_{j=1}^{10} a_j \\\\\n&= (7.4)(2N)-55,\n\\end{align*}\nwhence $S_1 \\leq 7.4N-27.5 \\leq S_{N-4}$. It follows that there is some $k$ such that $S_k \\in [7.4N-40, 7.4N-15]$, since this interval has length $25$ and $7.4N-27.5$ lies inside it.\n\n\nFor this value of $k$, note that both $S_k$ and $7.4N$ are integers (the latter since the sum of all scores in the class is the integer $(7.4)(2N)$ and so $N$ must be divisible by $5$). Thus there is an integer $m$ with $15 \\leq m \\leq 40$ for which $S_k = 7.4N-m$. By our first claim, we can choose five scores from $a_1,\\ldots,a_{10}$ whose sum is $m$. When we add these to the sum of the $N-5$ scores $a_{k+10},\\ldots,a_{k+N+4}$, we get precisely $7.4N$. We have now found $N$ scores whose sum is $7.4N$ and thus whose average is $7.4$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Third solution.}\nIt will suffices to show that given any partition of the students into two groups of $N$, if the sums are not equal we can bring them closer together by swapping one pair of students between the two groups.

A line intersecting $T$ must intersect two of the three sides of $T$. First consider a line intersecting the segments $AB$ at $X$ and $BC$ at $Y$, and let $BX=x$, $BY=y$. This line is an area equalizer if and only if $xy\\sin B = 2\\operatorname{area}(\\triangle XBY) = \\operatorname{area}(\\triangle ABC) = \\frac{1}{2}ac\\sin B$, that is, $2xy=ac$. Since $x \\leq c$ and $y \\leq a$, the area equalizers correspond to values of $x,y$ with $xy=ac/2$ and $x \\in [c/2,c]$. Such an area equalizer is also an equalizer if and only if $p/2=x+y$, where $p=a+b+c$ is the perimeter of $T$. If we write $f(x) = x+ac/(2x)$, then we want to solve $f(x) = p/2$ for $x \\in [c/2,c]$. Now note that $f$ is convex, $f(c/2) = a+c/2 > p/2$, and $f(c) = a/2+c < p/2$; it follows that there is exactly one solution to $f(x)=p/2$ in $[c/2,c]$.\nSimilarly, for equalizers intersecting $T$ on the sides $AB$ and $AC$, we want to solve $g(x) = p/2$ where $g(x) = x+bc/(2x)$ and $x \\in [c/2,c]$; since $g$ is convex and $g(c/2)<p/2$, $g(c) < p/2$, there are no such solutions.\n\n\nIt follows that if $T$ has exactly two equalizers, then it must have exactly one equalizer intersecting $T$ on the sides $AC$ and $BC$. Here we want to solve $h(x) = p/2$ where $h(x) = x+ab/(2x)$ and $x \\in [a/2,a]$. Now $h$ is convex and $h(a/2) > p/2$, $h(a) > p/2$; thus $h(x) = p/2$ has exactly one solution $x \\in [a/2,a]$ if and only if there is $x_0 \\in [a/2,a]$ with $h'(x_0) = 0$ and $h(x_0) = p/2$.

Note that $\\sqrt{ab/2}$ is in $[a/2,a]$ since $a>b$ and $a<b+c<2b$.\n\n\nWe conclude that $T$ has two equalizers if and only if $8ab=(a+b+c)^2$. Note that $(a,b,c) = (9,8,7)$ works.

The tangent line to $\\omega$ at $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$. If $PE = PF$, find $EF$.\n  (Answer: $4$.)\n  \\ii (\\emph{Generalize to isosceles triangle}) Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $AB = AC$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\ol{BC}$. Let $P$ be a point on the circumcircle with $PA = PM$. The tangent to the circumcircle at $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Show that $PE = PF$.\n  \\ii (\\emph{Block coordinate bashes}) Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $AB = AC$ and circumcircle $\\omega$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\ol{BC}$. Let $P$ be a point on $\\omega$ with $PA = PM$. The tangent to $\\omega$ at $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Show that the circumcircle of $\\triangle AEF$ passes through the center of $\\omega$.\n  \\ii (\\emph{Delete isosceles condition}) Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\\omega$, and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\ol{BC}$. Let $P$ be a point on $\\omega$ with $PA = PH$. The tangent to $\\omega$ at $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Show that the circumcircle of $\\triangle AEF$ passes through the center of $\\omega$.\n  \\ii (\\emph{Add in both tangents}) Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\\omega$, and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\ol{BC}$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the points on $\\omega$ with $PA = PH$ and $QA = QH$. The tangent to $\\omega$ at $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E_1$ and $F_1$ respectively; the tangent to $\\omega$ at $Q$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E_2$ and $F_2$ respectively. Show that $E_1F_1 = E_2F_2$.\n  \\ii (\\emph{Merge v3 and v4}) Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\\omega$, and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\ol{BC}$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the points on $\\omega$ with $PA = PH$ and $QA = QH$. The tangent to $\\omega$ at $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E_1$ and $F_1$ respectively; the tangent to $\\omega$ at $Q$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E_2$ and $F_2$ respectively. Show that the circumcircles of $\\triangle AE_1F_1$ and $\\triangle AE_2F_2$ are congruent, and the line through their centers is parallel to the tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe problem bears Evan's name only because he suggested the changes v2 and v5.\n\\pagebreak", "category": "Geometry", "source": "TSTST", "year": 2018}

Note that $p(n)$\nand $p(n+2)$ have the same parity, and recall that any perfect square\nis congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4). Thus if $p(n)$ and $p(n+2)$ are perfect\nsquares, they are congruent mod 4. But $p(n+2) - p(n) \\equiv 2n^2 + 2b$\n(mod 4), which is not divisible by 4 if $n$ and $b$ have opposite parity.\n%\n% and likewise for $p(n+1)$ and $p(n+3)$.\n%But the ``third difference'' of $p$ is $p(n) -\n%3p(n+1) + 3p(n+2) - p(n+3) = 6$ (easy calculation), so that $p(n) +\n%p(n+1) - p(n+2) - p(n+3) \\equiv 2$ (mod 4).

Of course it\nsuffices to assume $P(z)$ has no repeated factors, which is to say $P(z)$\nand its derivative $P'(z)$ are relatively prime.\n\nIn particular, if we carry out the Euclidean algorithm on $P(z)$ and $P'(z)$\nwithout dividing, we get an integer $D$ (the discriminant of $P$) such that\nthe greatest common divisor of $P(n)$ and $P'(n)$ divides $D$ for any $n$.\nNow there exist infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p$ divides $P(n)$ for\nsome $n$: if there were only finitely many, say, $p_1, \\dots, p_k$, then\nfor any $n$ divisible by $m = P(0) p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, we have $P(n)\n\\equiv P(0) \\pmod{m}$, that is, $P(n)/P(0)$ is not divisible by $p_1,\n\\dots, p_k$, so must be $\\pm 1$, but then $P$ takes some value infinitely\nmany times, contradiction. In particular, we can choose some such $p$ not\ndividing $D$, and choose $n$ such that $p$ divides $P(n)$. Then $P(n+kp)\n\\equiv P(n) + kp P'(n) (\\mathrm{mod}\\,p)$\n(write out the Taylor series of the left side);\nin particular, since $p$ does not divide $P'(n)$, we can find some $k$\nsuch that $P(n+kp)$ is divisible by $p$ but not by $p^2$, and so\nis not a perfect square.\n\nThird solution: (from David Rusin, David Savitt, and Richard Stanley\nindependently)\nAssume that $n^{3}+an^{2}+bn+c$ is a square for all $n>0$.\nFor sufficiently large $n$,\n\\begin{align*}\n(n^{3/2} + \\frac{1}{2} an^{1/2} - 1)^{2} &< n^{3} + an^{2}+bn+c \\\\\n&<  (n^{3/2}+ \\frac{1}{2} an^{1/2}+1)^{2};\n\\end{align*}\nthus if $n$ is a large even perfect square, we have $n^{3}+an^{2}+bn+c =\n(n^{3/2} + \\frac{1}{2} an^{1/2})^{2}$. We conclude this is an\nequality of polynomials, but the right-hand side\nis not a perfect square for $n$ an even non-square, contradiction.\n(The reader might try generalizing this approach to arbitrary polynomials.\nA related argument, due to Greg Kuperberg: write $\\sqrt{n^3+an^2+bn+c}$\nas $n^{3/2}$ times a power series in $1/n$ and take two finite differences\nto get an expression which tends to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$, contradiction.)\n\nNote: in case $n^3 + an^2 + bn + c$ has no repeated factors, it is a\nsquare for only finitely many $n$, by a theorem of Siegel; work of Baker gives\nan explicit (but large) bound on such $n$.

{"id": "putnam-2014-b5", "question": "In the 75th annual Putnam Games, participants compete at mathematical games.\nPatniss and Keeta play a game in which they take turns choosing an element \nfrom the group of invertible $n \\times n$ matrices with entries in the field\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p \\mathbb{Z}$ of integers modulo $p$, where $n$ is a fixed positive integer and $p$ is a fixed prime number. The rules of the game are:\n\\begin{enumerate}", "solution": "We show that Patniss wins if $p=2$ and Keeta wins if $p>2$ (for all $n$).\nWe first analyze the analogous game played using an arbitrary finite group $G$.\nRecall that for any subset $S$ of $G$, the set of elements $g \\in G$ which commute with all elements of $S$ forms a subgroup $Z(S)$ of $G$, called the \\emph{centralizer} (or \\emph{commutant}) of $S$. \nAt any given point in the game, the set $S$ of previously chosen elements is contained in $Z(S)$. Initially $S = \\emptyset$ and $Z(S) = G$;\nafter each turn, $S$ is increased by one element and $Z(S)$ is replaced by a subgroup.\nIn particular, if the order of $Z(S)$ is odd at some point, it remains odd thereafter;\nconversely, if $S$ contains an element of even order, then the order of $Z(S)$ remains even thereafter. Therefore, any element $g \\in G$ for which $Z(\\{g\\})$ has odd order is a winning first move for Patniss, while any other first move by Patniss loses if Keeta responds with some $h \\in Z(\\{g\\})$ of even order (e.g., an element of a 2-Sylow subgroup of $Z(\\{g\\})$). In both cases, the win is guaranteed no matter what moves follow.\n\nNow let $G$ be the group of invertible $n \\times n$ matrices with entries in $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$.\nIf $p>2$, then $Z(S)$ will always contain the scalar matrix $-1$ of order 2, so the win for Keeta is guaranteed. (An explicit winning strategy is to answer any move $g$ with the move $-g$.)\n\nIf $p=2$, we establish the existence of $g \\in G$ such that $Z(\\{g\\})$ has odd order\nusing the existence of an irreducible polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ (see remark). We construct an $n \\times n$ matrix over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ with characteristic polynomial $P(x)$ by taking the \\emph{companion matrix} of $P(x)$: write $P(x) = x^n + P_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + P_0$ and set\n\\[\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & -P_0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & -P_1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 & -P_2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 & -P_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nIn particular, $\\det(g) = (-1)^n P_0 \\neq 0$, so $g \\in G$.\nOver an algebraic closure of $\\ZZ/p \\ZZ$, $g$ becomes diagonalizable with distinct eigenvalues, so any matrix commuting with $g$ must also be diagonalizable, and hence of odd order. In particular, $Z(\\{g\\})$ is of odd order, so Patniss has a winning strategy.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nIt can be shown that in the case $p=2$, the only elements $g \\in G$ for which $Z(\\{g\\})$ has odd order are those for which $g$ has distinct eigenvalues: in any other case, $Z(\\{g\\})$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to the group of $k \\times k$ invertible matrices over $\\ZZ/2\\ZZ$ for some $k>1$, and this group has order $(2^k-1)(2^k-2) \\cdots(2^k - 2^{k-1})$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nWe sketch two ways to verify the existence of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ for any positive integer $n$ and any prime number $p$. One is to use M\\\"obius inversion to count the number of irreducible polynomials of degree $n$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ and then give a positive lower bound for this count. The other is to first establish the existence of a finite field $\\FF$ of cardinality $p^n$, e.g., as the set of roots of the polynomial $x^{p^n}-1$ inside a splitting field, and then take the minimal polynomial of a nonzero element of $\\FF$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ which is a primitive $(p^n-1)$-st root of unity in $\\FF$ (which exist because the multiplicative group of $\\FF$ contains at most one cyclic subgroup of any given order). One might be tempted to apply the primitive element theorem for $\\FF$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$, but in fact one of the preceding techniques is needed in order to verify this result for finite fields, as the standard argument that ``most'' elements of the upper field are primitive breaks down for finite fields.\n\nOne may also describe the preceding analysis in terms of an identification of $\\FF$ as a $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$-vector space with the space of column vectors of length $n$. Under such an identification, if we take $g$ to be an element of $\\FF - \\{0\\}$ generating this group, then any element of $Z(\\{g\\})$ commutes with all of $\\FF- \\{0\\}$ and hence must define an $\\FF$-linear endomorphism of $\\FF$. Any such endomorphism is itself multiplication by an element of $\\FF$, so $Z(\\{g\\})$ is identified with the multiplicative group of $\\FF$, whose order is the odd number $2^n-1$.", "category": "Algebra", "source": "PUTNAM", "year": 2014}

In the first quadrant of an infinite grid, consider the increasing \"staircase\" obtained by shading in dark the bottom \\(a_{i}\\) cells of the \\(i\\) th column for \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\). We will prove that there are at most \\(n^{2}\\) dark cells.\n\nTo do it, consider the \\(n \\times n\\) square \\(S\\) in the first quadrant with a vertex at the origin. Also consider the \\(n \\times n\\) square directly to the left of \\(S\\). Starting from its lower left corner, shade in light the leftmost \\(a_{j}\\) cells of the \\(j\\) th row for \\(1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n\\). Equivalently, the light shading is obtained by reflecting the dark shading across the line \\(x=y\\) and translating it \\(n\\) units to the left. The figure below illustrates this construction for the sequence \\(6,6,6,7,7,7,8,12,12,14\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-14}\n\nWe claim that there is no cell in \\(S\\) which is both dark and light. Assume, contrariwise, that there is such a cell in column \\(i\\). Consider the highest dark cell in column \\(i\\) which is inside \\(S\\). Since it is above a light cell and inside \\(S\\), it must be light as well. There are two cases:\n\nCase 1. \\(a_{i} \\leqslant n\\)\nIf \\(a_{i} \\leqslant n\\) then this dark and light cell is \\(\\left(i, a_{i}\\right)\\), as highlighted in the figure. However, this is the \\((n+i)\\)-th cell in row \\(a_{i}\\), and we only shaded \\(a_{a_{i}}<n+i\\) light cells in that row, a contradiction.\n\nCase 2. \\(a_{i} \\geqslant n+1\\)\nIf \\(a_{i} \\geqslant n+1\\), this dark and light cell is ( \\(i, n\\) ). This is the ( \\(n+i\\) )-th cell in row \\(n\\) and we shaded \\(a_{n} \\leqslant a_{1}+n\\) light cells in this row, so we must have \\(i \\leqslant a_{1}\\). But \\(a_{1} \\leqslant a_{a_{1}} \\leqslant n\\) by (1) and (2), so \\(i \\leqslant a_{1}\\) implies \\(a_{i} \\leqslant a_{a_{1}} \\leqslant n\\), contradicting our assumption.\n\nWe conclude that there are no cells in \\(S\\) which are both dark and light. It follows that the number of shaded cells in \\(S\\) is at most \\(n^{2}\\).\n\nFinally, observe that if we had a light cell to the right of \\(S\\), then by symmetry we would have a dark cell above \\(S\\), and then the cell ( \\(n, n\\) ) would be dark and light. It follows that the number of light cells in \\(S\\) equals the number of dark cells outside of \\(S\\), and therefore the number of shaded cells in \\(S\\) equals \\(a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n}\\). The desired result follows.\n\nSolution 3. As in Solution 1, we first establish that \\(a_{i} \\leqslant n+i-1\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\). Now define \\(c_{i}=\\max \\left(a_{i}, i\\right)\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\) and extend the sequence \\(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots\\) periodically modulo \\(n\\). We claim that this sequence also satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nFor \\(1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n\\) we have \\(a_{i} \\leqslant a_{j}\\) and \\(i<j\\), so \\(c_{i} \\leqslant c_{j}\\). Also \\(a_{n} \\leqslant a_{1}+n\\) and \\(n<1+n\\) imply \\(c_{n} \\leqslant c_{1}+n\\). Finally, the definitions imply that \\(c_{c_{i}} \\in\\left\\{a_{a_{i}}, a_{i}, a_{i}-n, i\\right\\}\\) so \\(c_{c_{i}} \\leqslant n+i-1\\) by (2) and (3). This establishes (1) and (2) for \\(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots\\).\n\nOur new sequence has the additional property that\n\n\\[\nc_{i} \\geqslant i \\quad \\text { for } i=1,2, \\ldots, n,\n\\]\n\nwhich allows us to construct the following visualization: Consider \\(n\\) equally spaced points on a circle, sequentially labelled \\(1,2, \\ldots, n(\\bmod n)\\), so point \\(k\\) is also labelled \\(n+k\\). We draw arrows from vertex \\(i\\) to vertices \\(i+1, \\ldots, c_{i}\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\), keeping in mind that \\(c_{i} \\geqslant i\\) by (6). Since \\(c_{i} \\leqslant n+i-1\\) by (3), no arrow will be drawn twice, and there is no arrow from a vertex to itself. The total number of arrows is\n\n\\[\n\\text { number of arrows }=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(c_{i}-i\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i}-\\binom{n+1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow we show that we never draw both arrows \\(i \\rightarrow j\\) and \\(j \\rightarrow i\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n\\). Assume contrariwise. This means, respectively, that\n\n\\[\ni<j \\leqslant c_{i} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad j<n+i \\leqslant c_{j}\n\\]\n\nWe have \\(n+i \\leqslant c_{j} \\leqslant c_{1}+n\\) by (1), so \\(i \\leqslant c_{1}\\). Since \\(c_{1} \\leqslant n\\) by (3), this implies that \\(c_{i} \\leqslant c_{c_{1}} \\leqslant n\\) using (1) and (3). But then, using (1) again, \\(j \\leqslant c_{i} \\leqslant n\\) implies \\(c_{j} \\leqslant c_{c_{i}}\\), which combined with \\(n+i \\leqslant c_{j}\\) gives us that \\(n+i \\leqslant c_{c_{i}}\\). This contradicts (2).\n\nThis means that the number of arrows is at most \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\), which implies that\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i} \\leqslant\\binom{ n}{2}+\\binom{n+1}{2}=n^{2}\n\\]\n\nRecalling that \\(a_{i} \\leqslant c_{i}\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\), the desired inequality follows.\nComment 1. We sketch an alternative proof by induction. Begin by verifying the initial case \\(n=1\\) and the simple cases when \\(a_{1}=1, a_{1}=n\\), or \\(a_{n} \\leqslant n\\). Then, as in Solution 1, consider the index \\(t\\) such that \\(a_{1} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant a_{t} \\leqslant n<a_{t+1} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant a_{n}\\). Observe again that \\(a_{1} \\leqslant t\\). Define the sequence \\(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{n-1}\\) by\n\n\\[\nd_{i}= \\begin{cases}a_{i+1}-1 & \\text { if } i \\leqslant t-1 \\\\ a_{i+1}-2 & \\text { if } i \\geqslant t\n\\]\n\nand extend it periodically modulo \\(n-1\\). One may verify that this sequence also satisfies the hypotheses of the problem. The induction hypothesis then gives \\(d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{n-1} \\leqslant(n-1)^{2}\\), which implies that\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}=a_{1}+\\sum_{i=2}^{t}\\left(d_{i-1}+1\\right)+\\sum_{i=t+1}^{n}\\left(d_{i-1}+2\\right) \\leqslant t+(t-1)+2(n-t)+(n-1)^{2}=n^{2}\n\\]\n\nComment 2. One unusual feature of this problem is that there are many different sequences for which equality holds. The discovery of such optimal sequences is not difficult, and it is useful in guiding the steps of a proof.\n\nIn fact, Solution 2 gives a complete description of the optimal sequences. Start with any lattice path \\(P\\) from the lower left to the upper right corner of the \\(n \\times n\\) square \\(S\\) using only steps up and right, such that the total number of steps along the left and top edges of \\(S\\) is at least \\(n\\). Shade the cells of \\(S\\) below \\(P\\) dark, and the cells of \\(S\\) above \\(P\\) light. Now reflect the light shape across the line \\(x=y\\) and shift it up \\(n\\) units, and shade it dark. As Solution 2 shows, the dark region will then correspond to an optimal sequence, and every optimal sequence arises in this way."}

Let us denote by \\(R_{i}\\) the range of \\(f^{i}\\); note that \\(R_{0}=\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0}\\) since \\(f^{0}\\) is the identity function. Obviously, \\(R_{0} \\supseteq R_{1} \\supseteq \\ldots\\). Next, from (2) we get that if \\(a \\in R_{4}\\) then also \\(a+1 \\in R_{4}\\). This implies that \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\backslash R_{4}\\) - and hence \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\backslash R_{1}\\) - is finite. In particular, \\(R_{1}\\) is unbounded.\n\nAssume that \\(f(m)=f(n)\\) for some distinct \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). Then from (\\textit{) we obtain \\(f(m+1)=\\) \\(f(n+1)\\); by an easy induction we then get that \\(f(m+c)=f(n+c)\\) for every \\(c \\geqslant 0\\). So the function \\(f(k)\\) is periodic with period \\(|m-n|\\) for \\(k \\geqslant m\\), and thus \\(R_{1}\\) should be bounded, which is false. So, \\(f\\) is injective.\nII. Denote now \\(S_{i}=R_{i-1} \\backslash R_{i}\\); all these sets are finite for \\(i \\leqslant 4\\). On the other hand, by the injectivity we have \\(n \\in S_{i} \\Longleftrightarrow f(n) \\in S_{i+1}\\). By the injectivity again, \\(f\\) implements a bijection between \\(S_{i}\\) and \\(S_{i+1}\\), thus \\(\\left|S_{1}\\right|=\\left|S_{2}\\right|=\\ldots\\); denote this common cardinality by \\(k\\). If \\(0 \\in R_{3}\\) then \\(0=f(f(f(n)))\\) for some \\(n\\), thus from (}) we get \\(f(n+1)=-1\\) which is impossible. Therefore \\(0 \\in R_{0} \\backslash R_{3}=S_{1} \\cup S_{2} \\cup S_{3}\\), thus \\(k \\geqslant 1\\).\n\nNext, let us describe the elements \\(b\\) of \\(R_{0} \\backslash R_{3}=S_{1} \\cup S_{2} \\cup S_{3}\\). We claim that each such element satisfies at least one of three conditions \\((i) b=0,(i i) b=f(0)+1\\), and \\((i i i) b-1 \\in S_{1}\\).

In this case we have obtained the first of two answers; checking that is satisfies (*) is straightforward.\nCase 2. Assume now that \\(f^{2}(a)=0\\); then by (3) we get \\(a=f(0)+1\\). By (4) we get \\(f(a+1)=\\) \\(f^{2}(a)=0\\), then \\(f(0)=f^{3}(a)=f(a+1)+1=1\\), hence \\(a=f(0)+1=2\\) and \\(f(2)=3\\) by (4). To summarize,\n\n\\[\nf(0)=1, \\quad f(2)=3, \\quad f(3)=0\n\\]\n\nNow let us prove by induction on \\(m\\) that (1) holds for all \\(n=4 k, 4 k+2,4 k+3\\) with \\(k \\leqslant m\\) and for all \\(n=4 k+1\\) with \\(k<m\\). The base case \\(m=0\\) is established above. For the step, assume that \\(m \\geqslant 1\\). From (*) we get \\(f^{3}(4 m-3)=f(4 m-2)+1=4 m\\). Next, by (2) we have\n\n\\[\nf(4 m)=f^{4}(4 m-3)=f^{4}(4 m-4)+1=f^{3}(4 m-3)+1=4 m+1\n\\]\n\nThen by the induction hypothesis together with (*) we successively obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(4 m-3)=f^{3}(4 m-1)=f(4 m)+1=4 m+2 \n& f(4 m+2)=f^{3}(4 m-4)=f(4 m-3)+1=4 m+3 \n& f(4 m+3)=f^{3}(4 m-3)=f(4 m-2)+1=4 m\n\n\\]\n\nthus finishing the induction step.\nFinally, it is straightforward to check that the constructed function works:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf^{3}(4 k) & =4 k+7=f(4 k+1)+1, & & f^{3}(4 k+1)=4 k+4=f(4 k+2)+1 \nf^{3}(4 k+2) & =4 k+1=f(4 k+3)+1, & & f^{3}(4 k+3)=4 k+6=f(4 k+4)+1\n\n\\]\n\nSolution 2. I. For convenience, let us introduce the function \\(g(n)=f(n)+1\\). Substituting \\(f(n)\\) instead of \\(n\\) into (*) we obtain\n\n\\[\nf^{4}(n)=f(f(n)+1)+1, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad f^{4}(n)=g^{2}(n)\n\\]\n\nApplying \\(f\\) to both parts of (*) and using (5) we get\n\n\\[\nf^{4}(n)+1=f(f(n+1)+1)+1=f^{4}(n+1)\n\\]\n\nThus, if \\(g^{2}(0)=f^{4}(0)=c\\) then an easy induction on \\(n\\) shows that\n\n\\[\ng^{2}(n)=f^{4}(n)=n+c, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0}\n\\]\n\nThis relation implies that both \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are injective: if, say, \\(f(m)=f(n)\\) then \\(m+c=\\) \\(f^{4}(m)=f^{4}(n)=n+c\\). Next, since \\(g(n) \\geqslant 1\\) for every \\(n\\), we have \\(c=g^{2}(0) \\geqslant 1\\). Thus from (7) again we obtain \\(f(n) \\neq n\\) and \\(g(n) \\neq n\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0}\\).\nII. Next, application of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) to (7) yields\n\n\\[\nf(n+c)=f^{5}(n)=f^{4}(f(n))=f(n)+c \\quad \\text { and } \\quad g(n+c)=g^{3}(n)=g(n)+c\n\\]\n\nIn particular, this means that if \\(m \\equiv n(\\bmod c)\\) then \\(f(m) \\equiv f(n)(\\bmod c)\\).

Assume that a graph \\(G\\) admits a proper coloring in \\(n\\) colors \\((n>1)\\). Then one may perform a sequence of operations resulting in a graph which admits a proper coloring in \\(n-1\\) colors.\nProof.

Surely this graph also admits a proper coloring in \\(n\\) colors \\(1, \\ldots, n\\); let us fix this coloring.\n\nNow apply the operation (ii) to this graph.

If these were the only operations applied, then the resulting graph \\(G_{n}^{m}\\) has the set of vertices which can be enumerated as\n\n\\[\nV_{n}^{m}=\\left\\{A_{i}^{j}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n, 0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant 2^{m}-1\\right\\},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A_{i}^{0}\\) is the common \"ancestor\" of all the vertices \\(A_{i}^{j}\\), and the binary expansion of \\(j\\) (adjoined with some zeroes at the left to have \\(m\\) digits) \"keeps the history\" of this vertex: the \\(d\\) th digit from the right is 0 if at the \\(d\\) th doubling the ancestor of \\(A_{i}^{j}\\) was in the original part, and this digit is 1 if it was in the copy.\n\nNext, the two vertices \\(A_{i}^{j}\\) and \\(A_{k}^{\\ell}\\) in \\(G_{n}^{m}\\) are connected with an edge exactly if either (1) \\(j=\\ell\\) and there was an edge between \\(A_{i}^{0}\\) and \\(A_{k}^{0}\\) (so these vertices appeared at the same application of operation ( \\(i i\\) )); or (2) \\(i=k\\) and the binary expansions of \\(j\\) and \\(\\ell\\) differ in exactly one digit (so their ancestors became connected as a copy and the original vertex at some application of (ii)).\n\nNow, if some operations \\((i)\\) were applied during the process, then simply some vertices in \\(G_{n}^{m}\\) disappeared. So, in any case the resulting graph is some induced subgraph of \\(G_{n}^{m}\\).\nIII. Finally, we will show that from each (not necessarily induced) subgraph of \\(G_{n}^{m}\\) one can obtain a graph with no vertices by applying operations (i), (ii) and (iii). We proceed by induction on \\(n\\); the base case \\(n=0\\) is trivial.\n\nFor the induction step, let us show how to apply several operations so as to obtain a graph containing no vertices of the form \\(A_{n}^{j}\\) for \\(j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). We will do this in three steps.\nStep 1. We apply repeatedly operation ( \\(i\\) ) to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. In the resulting graph, all vertices have even degrees.\nStep 2. Apply operation (ii) obtaining a subgraph of \\(G_{n}^{m+1}\\) with all degrees being odd. In this graph, we delete one by one all the vertices \\(A_{n}^{j}\\) where the sum of the binary digits of \\(j\\) is even; it is possible since there are no edges between such vertices, so all their degrees remain odd. After that, we delete all isolated vertices.\nStep 3. Finally, consider any remaining vertex \\(A_{n}^{j}\\) (then the sum of digits of \\(j\\) is odd). If its degree is odd, then we simply delete it. Otherwise, since \\(A_{n}^{j}\\) is not isolated, we consider any vertex adjacent to it. It has the form \\(A_{k}^{j}\\) for some \\(k<n\\) (otherwise it would have the form \\(A_{n}^{\\ell}\\), where \\(\\ell\\) has an even digit sum; but any such vertex has already been deleted at Step 2). No neighbor of \\(A_{k}^{j}\\) was deleted at Steps 2 and 3, so it has an odd degree. Then we successively delete \\(A_{k}^{j}\\) and \\(A_{n}^{j}\\).\n\nNotice that this deletion does not affect the applicability of this step to other vertices, since no two vertices \\(A_{i}^{j}\\) and \\(A_{k}^{\\ell}\\) for different \\(j, \\ell\\) with odd digit sum are connected with an edge. Thus we will delete all the remaining vertices of the form \\(A_{n}^{j}\\), obtaining a subgraph of \\(G_{n-1}^{m+1}\\). The application of the induction hypothesis finishes the proof.\n\nComment. In fact, the graph \\(G_{n}^{m}\\) is a Cartesian product of \\(G\\) and the graph of an \\(m\\)-dimensional hypercube."}

In a beautiful arrangement, the \\(k\\)-chords are aligned for any integer \\(k\\).\nProof. We proceed by induction. For \\(n \\leqslant 3\\) the statement is trivial. Now let \\(n \\geqslant 4\\), and proceed by contradiction. Consider a beautiful arrangement \\(S\\) where the three \\(k\\)-chords \\(A, B, C\\) are not aligned. If \\(n\\) is not among the endpoints of \\(A, B\\), and \\(C\\), then by deleting \\(n\\) from \\(S\\) we obtain a beautiful arrangement \\(S \\backslash\\{n\\}\\) of \\([0, n-1]\\), where \\(A, B\\), and \\(C\\) are aligned by the induction hypothesis. Similarly, if 0 is not among these endpoints, then deleting 0 and decreasing all the numbers by 1 gives a beautiful arrangement \\(S \\backslash\\{0\\}\\) where \\(A, B\\), and \\(C\\) are aligned. Therefore both 0 and \\(n\\) are among the endpoints of these segments. If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are their respective partners, we have \\(n \\geqslant 0+x=k=n+y \\geqslant n\\). Thus 0 and \\(n\\) are the endpoints of one of the chords; say it is \\(C\\).\n\nLet \\(D\\) be the chord formed by the numbers \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) which are adjacent to 0 and \\(n\\) and on the same side of \\(C\\) as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), as shown in Figure 2. Set \\(t=u+v\\). If we had \\(t=n\\), the \\(n\\)-chords \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\) would not be aligned in the beautiful arrangement \\(S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}\\), contradicting the induction hypothesis. If \\(t<n\\), then the \\(t\\)-chord from 0 to \\(t\\) cannot intersect \\(D\\), so the chord \\(C\\) separates \\(t\\) and \\(D\\). The chord \\(E\\) from \\(t\\) to \\(n-t\\) does not intersect \\(C\\), so \\(t\\) and \\(n-t\\) are on the same side of \\(C\\). But then the chords \\(A, B\\), and \\(E\\) are not aligned in \\(S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}\\), a contradiction. Finally, the case \\(t>n\\) is equivalent to the case \\(t<n\\) via the beauty-preserving relabelling \\(x \\mapsto n-x\\) for \\(0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n\\), which sends \\(t\\)-chords to ( \\(2 n-t\\) )-chords. This proves the Claim.\n\nHaving established the Claim, we prove the desired result by induction. The case \\(n=2\\) is trivial. Now assume that \\(n \\geqslant 3\\). Let \\(S\\) be a beautiful arrangement of \\([0, n]\\) and delete \\(n\\) to obtain\nthe beautiful arrangement \\(T\\) of \\([0, n-1]\\). The \\(n\\)-chords of \\(T\\) are aligned, and they contain every point except 0. Say \\(T\\) is of Type 1 if 0 lies between two of these \\(n\\)-chords, and it is of Type 2 otherwise; i.e., if 0 is aligned with these \\(n\\)-chords. We will show that each Type 1 arrangement of \\([0, n-1]\\) arises from a unique arrangement of \\([0, n]\\), and each Type 2 arrangement of \\([0, n-1]\\) arises from exactly two beautiful arrangements of \\([0, n]\\).\n\nIf \\(T\\) is of Type 1 , let 0 lie between chords \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Since the chord from 0 to \\(n\\) must be aligned with \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(S, n\\) must be on the other arc between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Therefore \\(S\\) can be recovered uniquely from \\(T\\). In the other direction, if \\(T\\) is of Type 1 and we insert \\(n\\) as above, then we claim the resulting arrangement \\(S\\) is beautiful. For \\(0<k<n\\), the \\(k\\)-chords of \\(S\\) are also \\(k\\)-chords of \\(T\\), so they are aligned. Finally, for \\(n<k<2 n\\), notice that the \\(n\\)-chords of \\(S\\) are parallel by construction, so there is an antisymmetry axis \\(\\ell\\) such that \\(x\\) is symmetric to \\(n-x\\) with respect to \\(\\ell\\) for all \\(x\\). If we had two \\(k\\)-chords which intersect, then their reflections across \\(\\ell\\) would be two ( \\(2 n-k\\) )-chords which intersect, where \\(0<2 n-k<n\\), a contradiction.\n\nIf \\(T\\) is of Type 2, there are two possible positions for \\(n\\) in \\(S\\), on either side of 0 . As above, we check that both positions lead to beautiful arrangements of \\([0, n]\\).\n\nHence if we let \\(M_{n}\\) be the number of beautiful arrangements of \\([0, n]\\), and let \\(L_{n}\\) be the number of beautiful arrangements of \\([0, n-1]\\) of Type 2, we have\n\n\\[\nM_{n}=\\left(M_{n-1}-L_{n-1}\\right)+2 L_{n-1}=M_{n-1}+L_{n-1}\n\\]\n\nIt then remains to show that \\(L_{n-1}\\) is the number of pairs ( \\(x, y\\) ) of positive integers with \\(x+y=n\\) and \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1\\). Since \\(n \\geqslant 3\\), this number equals \\(\\varphi(n)=\\#\\{x: 1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n, \\operatorname{gcd}(x, n)=1\\}\\).\n\nTo prove this, consider a Type 2 beautiful arrangement of \\([0, n-1]\\). Label the positions \\(0, \\ldots, n-1(\\bmod n)\\) clockwise around the circle, so that number 0 is in position 0 . Let \\(f(i)\\) be the number in position \\(i\\); note that \\(f\\) is a permutation of \\([0, n-1]\\). Let \\(a\\) be the position such that \\(f(a)=n-1\\).\n\nSince the \\(n\\)-chords are aligned with 0 , and every point is in an \\(n\\)-chord, these chords are all parallel and\n\n\\[\nf(i)+f(-i)=n \\quad \\text { for all } i\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, since the \\((n-1)\\)-chords are aligned and every point is in an \\((n-1)\\)-chord, these chords are also parallel and\n\n\\[\nf(i)+f(a-i)=n-1 \\quad \\text { for all } i\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(f(a-i)=f(-i)-1\\) for all \\(i\\); and since \\(f(0)=0\\), we get\n\n\\[\nf(-a k)=k \\quad \\text { for all } k\n\\]\n\nRecall that this is an equality modulo \\(n\\). Since \\(f\\) is a permutation, we must have \\((a, n)=1\\). Hence \\(L_{n-1} \\leqslant \\varphi(n)\\).\n\nTo prove equality, it remains to observe that the labeling (1) is beautiful. To see this, consider four numbers \\(w, x, y, z\\) on the circle with \\(w+y=x+z\\). Their positions around the circle satisfy \\((-a w)+(-a y)=(-a x)+(-a z)\\), which means that the chord from \\(w\\) to \\(y\\) and the chord from \\(x\\) to \\(z\\) are parallel. Thus (1) is beautiful, and by construction it has Type 2. The desired result follows.\n\nSolution 2. Notice that there are exactly \\(N\\) irreducible fractions \\(f_{1}<\\cdots<f_{N}\\) in \\((0,1)\\) whose denominator is at most \\(n\\), since the pair ( \\(x, y\\) ) with \\(x+y \\leqslant n\\) and ( \\(x, y\\) ) \\(=1\\) corresponds to the fraction \\(x /(x+y)\\). Write \\(f_{i}=\\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N\\).\n\nWe begin by constructing \\(N+1\\) beautiful arrangements. Take any \\(\\alpha \\in(0,1)\\) which is not one of the above \\(N\\) fractions. Consider a circle of perimeter 1 . Successively mark points \\(0,1,2, \\ldots, n\\) where 0 is arbitrary, and the clockwise distance from \\(i\\) to \\(i+1\\) is \\(\\alpha\\). The point \\(k\\) will be at clockwise distance \\(\\{k \\alpha\\}\\) from 0 , where \\(\\{r\\}\\) denotes the fractional part of \\(r\\). Call such a circular arrangement cyclic and denote it by \\(A(\\alpha)\\). If the clockwise order of the points is the same in \\(A\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(A\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)\\), we regard them as the same circular arrangement. Figure 3 shows the cyclic arrangement \\(A(3 / 5+\\epsilon)\\) of \\([0,13]\\) where \\(\\epsilon>0\\) is very small.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-35}\n\nFigure 3\nIf \\(0 \\leqslant a, b, c, d \\leqslant n\\) satisfy \\(a+c=b+d\\), then \\(a \\alpha+c \\alpha=b \\alpha+d \\alpha\\), so the chord from \\(a\\) to \\(c\\) is parallel to the chord from \\(b\\) to \\(d\\) in \\(A(\\alpha)\\). Hence in a cyclic arrangement all \\(k\\)-chords are parallel. In particular every cyclic arrangement is beautiful.\n\nNext we show that there are exactly \\(N+1\\) distinct cyclic arrangements. To see this, let us see how \\(A(\\alpha)\\) changes as we increase \\(\\alpha\\) from 0 to 1 . The order of points \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) changes precisely when we cross a value \\(\\alpha=f\\) such that \\(\\{p f\\}=\\{q f\\}\\); this can only happen if \\(f\\) is one of the \\(N\\) fractions \\(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{N}\\). Therefore there are at most \\(N+1\\) different cyclic arrangements.\n\nTo show they are all distinct, recall that \\(f_{i}=a_{i} / b_{i}\\) and let \\(\\epsilon>0\\) be a very small number. In the arrangement \\(A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)\\), point \\(k\\) lands at \\(\\frac{k a_{i}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)}{b_{i}}+k \\epsilon\\). Therefore the points are grouped into \\(b_{i}\\) clusters next to the points \\(0, \\frac{1}{b_{i}}, \\ldots, \\frac{b_{i}-1}{b_{i}}\\) of the circle. The cluster following \\(\\frac{k}{b_{i}}\\) contains the numbers congruent to \\(k a_{i}^{-1}\\) modulo \\(b_{i}\\), listed clockwise in increasing order. It follows that the first number after 0 in \\(A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)\\) is \\(b_{i}\\), and the first number after 0 which is less than \\(b_{i}\\) is \\(a_{i}^{-1}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)\\), which uniquely determines \\(a_{i}\\). In this way we can recover \\(f_{i}\\) from the cyclic arrangement. Note also that \\(A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)\\) is not the trivial arrangement where we list \\(0,1, \\ldots, n\\) in order clockwise. It follows that the \\(N+1\\) cyclic arrangements \\(A(\\epsilon), A\\left(f_{1}+\\epsilon\\right), \\ldots, A\\left(f_{N}+\\epsilon\\right)\\) are distinct.\n\nLet us record an observation which will be useful later:\n\n\\[\n\\text { if } f_{i}<\\alpha<f_{i+1} \\text { then } 0 \\text { is immediately after } b_{i+1} \\text { and before } b_{i} \\text { in } A(\\alpha) \\text {. }\n\\]\n\nIndeed, we already observed that \\(b_{i}\\) is the first number after 0 in \\(A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)\\). Similarly we see that \\(b_{i+1}\\) is the last number before 0 in \\(A\\left(f_{i+1}-\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)\\).\n\nFinally, we show that any beautiful arrangement of \\([0, n]\\) is cyclic by induction on \\(n\\). For \\(n \\leqslant 2\\) the result is clear. Now assume that all beautiful arrangements of \\([0, n-1]\\) are cyclic, and consider a beautiful arrangement \\(A\\) of \\([0, n]\\). The subarrangement \\(A_{n-1}=A \\backslash\\{n\\}\\) of \\([0, n-1]\\) obtained by deleting \\(n\\) is cyclic; say \\(A_{n-1}=A_{n-1}(\\alpha)\\).\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be between the consecutive fractions \\(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\) among the irreducible fractions of denominator at most \\(n-1\\). There is at most one fraction \\(\\frac{i}{n}\\) in ( \\(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}, \\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\) ), since \\(\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{i}{n-1} \\leqslant \\frac{i+1}{n}\\) for \\(0<i \\leqslant n-1\\).\n\nCase 1. There is no fraction with denominator \\(n\\) between \\(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}\\) and \\(\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\).\nIn this case the only cyclic arrangement extending \\(A_{n-1}(\\alpha)\\) is \\(A_{n}(\\alpha)\\). We know that \\(A\\) and \\(A_{n}(\\alpha)\\) can only differ in the position of \\(n\\). Assume \\(n\\) is immediately after \\(x\\) and before \\(y\\) in \\(A_{n}(\\alpha)\\). Since the neighbors of 0 are \\(q_{1}\\) and \\(q_{2}\\) by (2), we have \\(x, y \\geqslant 1\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-36}\n\nFigure 4\nIn \\(A_{n}(\\alpha)\\) the chord from \\(n-1\\) to \\(x\\) is parallel and adjacent to the chord from \\(n\\) to \\(x-1\\), so \\(n-1\\) is between \\(x-1\\) and \\(x\\) in clockwise order, as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, \\(n-1\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(y-1\\). Therefore \\(x, y, x-1, n-1\\), and \\(y-1\\) occur in this order in \\(A_{n}(\\alpha)\\) and hence in \\(A\\) (possibly with \\(y=x-1\\) or \\(x=y-1\\) ).\n\nNow, \\(A\\) may only differ from \\(A_{n}(\\alpha)\\) in the location of \\(n\\). In \\(A\\), since the chord from \\(n-1\\) to \\(x\\) and the chord from \\(n\\) to \\(x-1\\) do not intersect, \\(n\\) is between \\(x\\) and \\(n-1\\). Similarly, \\(n\\) is between \\(n-1\\) and \\(y\\). Then \\(n\\) must be between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and \\(A=A_{n}(\\alpha)\\). Therefore \\(A\\) is cyclic as desired.\nCase 2. There is exactly one \\(i\\) with \\(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\).\nIn this case there exist two cyclic arrangements \\(A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)\\) of the numbers \\(0, \\ldots, n\\) extending \\(A_{n-1}(\\alpha)\\), where \\(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\alpha_{1}<\\frac{i}{n}\\) and \\(\\frac{i}{n}<\\alpha_{2}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\). In \\(A_{n-1}(\\alpha), 0\\) is the only number between \\(q_{2}\\) and \\(q_{1}\\) by (2). For the same reason, \\(n\\) is between \\(q_{2}\\) and 0 in \\(A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)\\), and between 0 and \\(q_{1}\\) in \\(A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)\\).\n\nLetting \\(x=q_{2}\\) and \\(y=q_{1}\\), the argument of Case 1 tells us that \\(n\\) must be between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(A\\). Therefore \\(A\\) must equal \\(A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)\\) or \\(A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)\\), and therefore it is cyclic.\n\nThis concludes the proof that every beautiful arrangement is cyclic. It follows that there are exactly \\(N+1\\) beautiful arrangements of \\([0, n]\\) as we wished to show."}

Let \\(m\\) be the integer picked by player \\(A\\) in this round; we define an integer \\(y_{r}\\) by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y_{r}}{2^{m}} \\leqslant x_{r}<\\frac{y_{r}+1}{2^{m}}\n\\]\n\nNote that \\(I_{0}^{r}=\\left[y_{r} / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]\\) is the leftmost interval that may be painted in round \\(r\\) and that still contains some uncolored point.\n\nPlayer \\(B\\) now looks at the next interval \\(I_{1}^{r}=\\left[\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+2\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]\\). If \\(I_{1}^{r}\\) still contains an uncolored point, then player \\(B\\) blackens the interval \\(I_{1}^{r}\\); otherwise he blackens the interval \\(I_{0}^{r}\\). We make the convention that, at the beginning of the game, the interval \\([1,2]\\) is already blackened; thus, if \\(y_{r}+1=2^{m}\\), then \\(B\\) blackens \\(I_{0}^{r}\\).\n\nOur aim is to estimate the amount of ink used after each round. Firstly, we will prove by induction that, if before \\(r\\) th round the segment \\([0,1]\\) is not completely colored, then, before this move,\n(i) the amount of ink used for the segment \\(\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]\\) is at most \\(3 x_{r}\\); and\n(ii) for every \\(m, B\\) has blackened at most one interval of length \\(1 / 2^{m}\\) to the right of \\(x_{r}\\).\n\nObviously, these conditions are satisfied for \\(r=0\\). Now assume that they were satisfied before the \\(r\\) th move, and consider the situation after this move; let \\(m\\) be the number \\(A\\) has picked at this move.\n\nIf \\(B\\) has blackened the interval \\(I_{1}^{r}\\) at this move, then \\(x_{r+1}=x_{r}\\), and \\((i)\\) holds by the induction hypothesis. Next, had \\(B\\) blackened before the \\(r\\) th move any interval of length \\(1 / 2^{m}\\) to the right of \\(x_{r}\\), this interval would necessarily coincide with \\(I_{1}^{r}\\). By our strategy, this cannot happen. So, condition (ii) also remains valid.\n\nAssume now that \\(B\\) has blackened the interval \\(I_{0}^{r}\\) at the \\(r\\) th move, but the interval \\([0,1]\\) still contains uncolored parts (which means that \\(I_{1}^{r}\\) is contained in \\([0,1]\\) ). Then condition ( \\(i i\\) ) clearly remains true, and we need to check ( \\(i\\) ) only. In our case, the intervals \\(I_{0}^{r}\\) and \\(I_{1}^{r}\\) are completely colored after the \\(r\\) th move, so \\(x_{r+1}\\) either reaches the right endpoint of \\(I_{1}\\) or moves even further to the right. So, \\(x_{r+1}=x_{r}+\\alpha\\) for some \\(\\alpha>1 / 2^{m}\\).\n\nNext, any interval blackened by \\(B\\) before the \\(r\\) th move which intersects ( \\(x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\) ) should be contained in \\(\\left[x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right]\\); by ( \\(i i\\) ), all such intervals have different lengths not exceeding \\(1 / 2^{m}\\), so the total amount of ink used for them is less than \\(2 / 2^{m}\\). Thus, the amount of ink used for the segment \\(\\left[0, x_{r+1}\\right]\\) does not exceed the sum of \\(2 / 2^{m}, 3 x_{r}\\) (used for \\(\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]\\) ), and \\(1 / 2^{m}\\) used for the\nsegment \\(I_{0}^{r}\\). In total it gives at most \\(3\\left(x_{r}+1 / 2^{m}\\right)<3\\left(x_{r}+\\alpha\\right)=3 x_{r+1}\\). Thus condition \\((i)\\) is also verified in this case. The claim is proved.\n\nFinally, we can perform the desired estimation. Consider any situation in the game, say after the \\((r-1)\\) st move; assume that the segment \\([0,1]\\) is not completely black. By \\((i i)\\), in the segment \\(\\left[x_{r}, 1\\right]\\) player \\(B\\) has colored several segments of different lengths; all these lengths are negative powers of 2 not exceeding \\(1-x_{r}\\); thus the total amount of ink used for this interval is at most \\(2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)\\). Using \\((i)\\), we obtain that the total amount of ink used is at most \\(3 x_{r}+2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)<3\\). Thus the pot is not empty, and therefore \\(A\\) never wins.\n\nComment 1. Notice that this strategy works even if the pot contains initially only 3 units of ink.\nComment 2. There exist other strategies for \\(B\\) allowing him to prevent emptying the pot before the whole interval is colored. On the other hand, let us mention some idea which does not work.\n\nPlayer \\(B\\) could try a strategy in which the set of blackened points in each round is an interval of the type \\([0, x]\\). Such a strategy cannot work (even if there is more ink available). Indeed, under the assumption that \\(B\\) uses such a strategy, let us prove by induction on \\(s\\) the following statement:\n\nFor any positive integer \\(s\\), player \\(A\\) has a strategy picking only positive integers \\(m \\leqslant s\\) in which, if player \\(B\\) ever paints a point \\(x \\geqslant 1-1 / 2^{s}\\) then after some move, exactly the interval \\(\\left[0,1-1 / 2^{s}\\right]\\) is blackened, and the amount of ink used up to this moment is at least \\(s / 2\\).\n\nFor the base case \\(s=1\\), player \\(A\\) just picks \\(m=1\\) in the first round. If for some positive integer \\(k\\) player \\(A\\) has such a strategy, for \\(s+1\\) he can first rescale his strategy to the interval \\([0,1 / 2]\\) (sending in each round half of the amount of ink he would give by the original strategy). Thus, after some round, the interval \\(\\left[0,1 / 2-1 / 2^{s+1}\\right]\\) becomes blackened, and the amount of ink used is at least \\(s / 4\\). Now player \\(A\\) picks \\(m=1 / 2\\), and player \\(B\\) spends \\(1 / 2\\) unit of ink to blacken the interval \\([0,1 / 2]\\). After that, player \\(A\\) again rescales his strategy to the interval \\([1 / 2,1]\\), and player \\(B\\) spends at least \\(s / 4\\) units of ink to blacken the interval \\(\\left[1 / 2,1-1 / 2^{s+1}\\right]\\), so he spends in total at least \\(s / 4+1 / 2+s / 4=(s+1) / 2\\) units of ink.\n\nComment 3. In order to avoid finiteness issues, the statement could be replaced by the following one:\nPlayers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) play a paintful game on the real numbers. Player \\(A\\) has a paint pot with four units of black ink. A quantity \\(p\\) of this ink suffices to blacken a (closed) real interval of length \\(p\\). In the beginning of the game, player \\(A\\) chooses (and announces) a positive integer \\(N\\). In every round, player \\(A\\) picks some positive integer \\(m \\leqslant N\\) and provides \\(1 / 2^{m}\\) units of ink from the pot.

The goal of player \\(A\\) is to reach a situation where the pot is empty and the interval \\([0,1]\\) is not completely blackened.\nDecide whether there exists a strategy for player \\(A\\) to win.\nHowever, the Problem Selection Committee believes that this version may turn out to be harder than the original one."}

Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{0}=\\overrightarrow{A B}+\\overrightarrow{B C}+\\overrightarrow{C D}+\\overrightarrow{D E}+\\overrightarrow{E F}+\\overrightarrow{F A}=(\\overrightarrow{A B}+\\overrightarrow{C D}+\\overrightarrow{E F})+R(\\overrightarrow{A B}+\\overrightarrow{C D}+\\overrightarrow{E F})\n\\]\n\nIf \\(R\\) is a rotation by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), then any two opposite sides of our hexagon are equal and parallel, so the three diagonals meet at their common midpoint. Otherwise, we must have\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{A B}+\\overrightarrow{C D}+\\overrightarrow{E F}=\\overrightarrow{0}\n\\]\n\nor else we would have two vectors with different directions whose sum is \\(\\overrightarrow{0}\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-47}\n\nThis allows us to consider a triangle \\(L M N\\) with \\(\\overrightarrow{L M}=\\overrightarrow{E F}, \\overrightarrow{M N}=\\overrightarrow{A B}\\), and \\(\\overrightarrow{N L}=\\overrightarrow{C D}\\). Let \\(O\\) be the circumcenter of \\(\\triangle L M N\\) and consider the points \\(O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}\\) such that \\(\\triangle A O_{1} B, \\triangle C O_{2} D\\), and \\(\\triangle E O_{3} F\\) are translations of \\(\\triangle M O N, \\triangle N O L\\), and \\(\\triangle L O M\\), respectively. Since \\(F O_{3}\\) and \\(A O_{1}\\) are translations of \\(M O\\), quadrilateral \\(A F O_{3} O_{1}\\) is a parallelogram and \\(O_{3} O_{1}=F A=C D=N L\\). Similarly, \\(O_{1} O_{2}=L M\\) and \\(O_{2} O_{3}=M N\\). Therefore \\(\\triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3} \\cong \\triangle L M N\\). Moreover, by means of the rotation \\(R\\) one may check that these triangles have the same orientation.\n\nLet \\(T\\) be the circumcenter of \\(\\triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3}\\). We claim that \\(A D, B E\\), and \\(C F\\) meet at \\(T\\). Let us show that \\(C, T\\), and \\(F\\) are collinear. Notice that \\(C O_{2}=O_{2} T=T O_{3}=O_{3} F\\) since they are all equal to the circumradius of \\(\\triangle L M N\\). Therefore \\(\\triangle T O_{3} F\\) and \\(\\triangle C O_{2} T\\) are isosceles. Using directed angles between rays again, we get\n\n\\[\n\\Varangle\\left(T F, T O_{3}\\right)=\\Varangle\\left(F O_{3}, F T\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\npreceq\\left(T O_{2}, T C\\right)=\\Varangle\\left(C T, C O_{2}\\right) .\n\\]\n\nAlso, \\(T\\) and \\(O\\) are the circumcenters of the congruent triangles \\(\\triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3}\\) and \\(\\triangle L M N\\) so we have \\(\\npreceq\\left(T O_{3}, T O_{2}\\right)=\\Varangle(O N, O M)\\). Since \\(C O_{2}\\) and \\(F O_{3}\\) are translations of \\(N O\\) and \\(M O\\) respectively, this implies\n\n\\[\n\\Varangle\\left(T O_{3}, T O_{2}\\right)=\\Varangle\\left(C O_{2}, F O_{3}\\right) .\n\\]\n\nAdding the three equations in (2) and (3) gives\n\n\\[\n\\Varangle(T F, T C)=\\Varangle(C T, F T)=-\\npreceq(T F, T C)\n\\]\n\nwhich implies that \\(T\\) is on \\(C F\\). Analogous arguments show that it is on \\(A D\\) and \\(B E\\) also. The desired result follows.\n\nSolution 3. Place the hexagon on the complex plane, with \\(A\\) at the origin and vertices labelled clockwise. Now \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\) represent the corresponding complex numbers. Also consider the complex numbers \\(a, b, c, a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\) given by \\(B-A=a, D-C=b, F-E=c, E-D=a^{\\prime}\\), \\(A-F=b^{\\prime}\\), and \\(C-B=c^{\\prime}\\). Let \\(k=|a| /|b|\\). From \\(a / b^{\\prime}=-k e^{i \\angle A}\\) and \\(a^{\\prime} / b=-k e^{i \\angle D}\\) we get that \\(\\left(a^{\\prime} / a\\right)\\left(b^{\\prime} / b\\right)=e^{-i \\theta}\\) and similarly \\(\\left(b^{\\prime} / b\\right)\\left(c^{\\prime} / c\\right)=e^{-i \\theta}\\) and \\(\\left(c^{\\prime} / c\\right)\\left(a^{\\prime} / a\\right)=e^{-i \\theta}\\).

Prove that the triangle \\(A B C\\) is right-angled.\n(Russia)", "category": "Geometry", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2013, "solution": "Denote the circumcircles of the triangles \\(A B C\\) and \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) by \\(\\Omega\\) and \\(\\Gamma\\), respectively. Denote the midpoint of the arc \\(C B\\) of \\(\\Omega\\) containing \\(A\\) by \\(A_{0}\\), and define \\(B_{0}\\) as well as \\(C_{0}\\) analogously. By our hypothesis the centre \\(Q\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\) lies on \\(\\Omega\\).\nLemma. One has \\(A_{0} B_{1}=A_{0} C_{1}\\). Moreover, the points \\(A, A_{0}, B_{1}\\), and \\(C_{1}\\) are concyclic. Finally, the points \\(A\\) and \\(A_{0}\\) lie on the same side of \\(B_{1} C_{1}\\). Similar statements hold for \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\nProof. Let us consider the case \\(A=A_{0}\\) first. Then the triangle \\(A B C\\) is isosceles at \\(A\\), which implies \\(A B_{1}=A C_{1}\\) while the remaining assertions of the Lemma are obvious. So let us suppose \\(A \\neq A_{0}\\) from now on.\n\nBy the definition of \\(A_{0}\\), we have \\(A_{0} B=A_{0} C\\). It is also well known and easy to show that \\(B C_{1}=\\) \\(C B_{1}\\). Next, we have \\(\\angle C_{1} B A_{0}=\\angle A B A_{0}=\\angle A C A_{0}=\\angle B_{1} C A_{0}\\). Hence the triangles \\(A_{0} B C_{1}\\) and \\(A_{0} C B_{1}\\) are congruent. This implies \\(A_{0} C_{1}=A_{0} B_{1}\\), establishing the first part of the Lemma. It also follows that \\(\\angle A_{0} C_{1} A=\\angle A_{0} B_{1} A\\), as these are exterior angles at the corresponding vertices \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(B_{1}\\) of the congruent triangles \\(A_{0} B C_{1}\\) and \\(A_{0} C B_{1}\\). For that reason the points \\(A, A_{0}, B_{1}\\), and \\(C_{1}\\) are indeed the vertices of some cyclic quadrilateral two opposite sides of which are \\(A A_{0}\\) and \\(B_{1} C_{1}\\).\n\nNow we turn to the solution. Evidently the points \\(A_{1}, B_{1}\\), and \\(C_{1}\\) lie interior to some semicircle arc of \\(\\Gamma\\), so the triangle \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) is obtuse-angled. Without loss of generality, we will assume that its angle at \\(B_{1}\\) is obtuse. Thus \\(Q\\) and \\(B_{1}\\) lie on different sides of \\(A_{1} C_{1}\\); obviously, the same holds for the points \\(B\\) and \\(B_{1}\\). So, the points \\(Q\\) and \\(B\\) are on the same side of \\(A_{1} C_{1}\\).\n\nNotice that the perpendicular bisector of \\(A_{1} C_{1}\\) intersects \\(\\Omega\\) at two points lying on different sides of \\(A_{1} C_{1}\\). By the first statement from the Lemma, both points \\(B_{0}\\) and \\(Q\\) are among these points of intersection; since they share the same side of \\(A_{1} C_{1}\\), they coincide (see Figure 1).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-49}\n\nFigure 1\n\nNow, by the first part of the Lemma again, the lines \\(Q A_{0}\\) and \\(Q C_{0}\\) are the perpendicular bisectors of \\(B_{1} C_{1}\\) and \\(A_{1} B_{1}\\), respectively. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\\angle C_{1} B_{0} B_{1}+\\angle B_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=2 \\angle A_{0} B_{0} B_{1}+2 \\angle B_{1} B_{0} C_{0}=2 \\angle A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A B C,\n\\]\n\nrecalling that \\(A_{0}\\) and \\(C_{0}\\) are the midpoints of the arcs \\(C B\\) and \\(B A\\), respectively.\nOn the other hand, by the second part of the Lemma we have\n\n\\[\n\\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\\angle C_{1} B A_{1}=\\angle A B C .\n\\]\n\nFrom the last two equalities, we get \\(\\angle A B C=90^{\\circ}\\), whereby the problem is solved.\nSolution 2. Let \\(Q\\) again denote the centre of the circumcircle of the triangle \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\), that lies on the circumcircle \\(\\Omega\\) of the triangle \\(A B C\\). We first consider the case where \\(Q\\) coincides with one of the vertices of \\(A B C\\), say \\(Q=B\\). Then \\(B C_{1}=B A_{1}\\) and consequently the triangle \\(A B C\\) is isosceles at \\(B\\). Moreover we have \\(B C_{1}=B_{1} C\\) in any triangle, and hence \\(B B_{1}=B C_{1}=B_{1} C\\); similarly, \\(B B_{1}=B_{1} A\\). It follows that \\(B_{1}\\) is the centre of \\(\\Omega\\) and that the triangle \\(A B C\\) has a right angle at \\(B\\).\n\nSo from now on we may suppose \\(Q \\notin\\{A, B, C\\}\\). We start with the following well known fact. Lemma. Let \\(X Y Z\\) and \\(X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\) be two triangles with \\(X Y=X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Y Z=Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\).\n(i) If \\(X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\angle Y Z X=\\angle Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\angle Z X Y+\\angle Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}\\).\n(ii) If \\(\\angle Y Z X+\\angle X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}\\), then \\(\\angle Z X Y=\\angle Y^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\).\n\nProof. For both parts, we may move the triangle \\(X Y Z\\) through the plane until \\(Y=Y^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Z=Z^{\\prime}\\). Possibly after reflecting one of the two triangles about \\(Y Z\\), we may also suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(X^{\\prime}\\) lie on the same side of \\(Y Z\\) if we are in case \\((i)\\) and on different sides if we are in case \\((i i)\\). In both cases, the points \\(X, Z\\), and \\(X^{\\prime}\\) are collinear due to the angle condition (see Fig. 2). Moreover we have \\(X \\neq X^{\\prime}\\), because in case ( \\(i\\) ) we assumed \\(X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\) and in case ( \\(i i\\) ) these points even lie on different sides of \\(Y Z\\). Thus the triangle \\(X X^{\\prime} Y\\) is isosceles at \\(Y\\). The claim now follows by considering the equal angles at its base.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-50(1)}\n\nFigure 2(i)\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-50}\n\nFigure 2(ii)\n\nRelabeling the vertices of the triangle \\(A B C\\) if necessary we may suppose that \\(Q\\) lies in the interior of the arc \\(A B\\) of \\(\\Omega\\) not containing \\(C\\). We will sometimes use tacitly that the six triangles \\(Q B A_{1}, Q A_{1} C, Q C B_{1}, Q B_{1} A, Q C_{1} A\\), and \\(Q B C_{1}\\) have the same orientation.\n\nAs \\(Q\\) cannot be the circumcentre of the triangle \\(A B C\\), it is impossible that \\(Q A=Q B=Q C\\) and thus we may also suppose that \\(Q C \\neq Q B\\). Now the above Lemma (i) is applicable to the triangles \\(Q B_{1} C\\) and \\(Q C_{1} B\\), since \\(Q B_{1}=Q C_{1}\\) and \\(B_{1} C=C_{1} B\\), while \\(\\angle B_{1} C Q=\\angle C_{1} B Q\\) holds as both angles appear over the same side of the chord \\(Q A\\) in \\(\\Omega\\) (see Fig. 3). So we get\n\n\\[\n\\angle C Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ} .\n\\]\n\nWe claim that \\(Q C=Q A\\). To see this, let us assume for the sake of a contradiction that \\(Q C \\neq Q A\\). Then arguing similarly as before but now with the triangles \\(Q A_{1} C\\) and \\(Q C_{1} A\\) we get\n\n\\[\n\\angle A_{1} Q C+\\angle C_{1} Q A=180^{\\circ} .\n\\]\n\nAdding this equation to (1), we get \\(\\angle A_{1} Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q A=360^{\\circ}\\), which is absurd as both summands lie in the interval \\(\\left(0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}\\right)\\).\n\nThis proves \\(Q C=Q A\\); so the triangles \\(Q A_{1} C\\) and \\(Q C_{1} A\\) are congruent their sides being equal, which in turn yields\n\n\\[\n\\angle A_{1} Q C=\\angle C_{1} Q A\n\\]\n\nFinally our Lemma ( \\(i i\\) ) is applicable to the triangles \\(Q A_{1} B\\) and \\(Q B_{1} A\\). Indeed we have \\(Q A_{1}=Q B_{1}\\) and \\(A_{1} B=B_{1} A\\) as usual, and the angle condition \\(\\angle A_{1} B Q+\\angle Q A B_{1}=180^{\\circ}\\) holds as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) lie on different sides of the chord \\(Q C\\) in \\(\\Omega\\). Consequently we have\n\n\\[\n\\angle B Q A_{1}=\\angle B_{1} Q A\n\\]\n\nFrom (1) and (3) we get\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\angle B_{1} Q C+\\angle B_{1} Q A\\right)+\\left(\\angle C_{1} Q B-\\angle B Q A_{1}\\right)=180^{\\circ}\n\\]\n\ni.e. \\(\\angle C Q A+\\angle A_{1} Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}\\). In light of (2) this may be rewritten as \\(2 \\angle C Q A=180^{\\circ}\\) and as \\(Q\\) lies on \\(\\Omega\\) this implies that the triangle \\(A B C\\) has a right angle at \\(B\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-51}\n\nFigure 3\n\nComment 1. One may also check that \\(Q\\) is in the interior of \\(\\Omega\\) if and only if the triangle \\(A B C\\) is acute-angled.\n\nComment 2. The original proposal asked to prove the converse statement as well: if the triangle \\(A B C\\) is right-angled, then the point \\(Q\\) lies on its circumcircle. The Problem Selection Committee thinks that the above simplified version is more suitable for the competition."}

Let us consider some large integer \\(s\\), and choose the minimal \\(k\\) such that \\(2\\left(k-r_{k}\\right) \\geqslant s+2^{s}\\); it exists by (4).

By (4) we have \\(2^{s}<2\\left(k-r_{k}\\right)<\\left(\\frac{2}{\\alpha}-2\\right) r_{k}-\\frac{2 c_{1}}{\\alpha}\\); if \\(s\\) is large this implies \\(r_{k}>s\\), so (6) also holds modulo \\(10^{s}\\). Then (6) and the lemma give\n\n\\[\ny_{k+1} \\equiv 5^{2\\left(k-r_{k}\\right)} c_{k}^{2}=5^{s+2^{s}} \\cdot 5^{d} c_{k}^{2} \\equiv 5^{s} \\cdot 5^{d} c_{k}^{2} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 10^{s}\\right)\n\\]\n\nBy (5) and the minimality of \\(k\\) we have \\(d \\leqslant 2 C\\), so \\(5^{d} c_{k}^{2} \\leqslant 5^{2 C} \\cdot 81=D\\).

Indeed, if Ana can make a first move at all in the game with initial number \\(n\\), then she leaves it in a position where the first player has a winning strategy, so that Banana can defeat her.\n\nIn particular, this implies that any two good numbers have a non-trivial common divisor. Also, \\(k\\) itself is good.\n\nFor brevity, we say that \\(n \\longrightarrow x\\) is a move if \\(n\\) and \\(x\\) are two coprime integers with \\(n>x \\geqslant k\\).\nClaim 1. If \\(n\\) is good and \\(n^{\\prime}\\) is a multiple of \\(n\\), then \\(n^{\\prime}\\) is also good.\nProof. If \\(n^{\\prime}\\) were bad, there would have to be some move \\(n^{\\prime} \\longrightarrow x\\), where \\(x\\) is good. As \\(n^{\\prime}\\) is a multiple of \\(n\\) this implies that the two good numbers \\(n\\) and \\(x\\) are coprime, which is absurd.\n\nClaim 2. If \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) denote two positive integers for which \\(r s \\geqslant k\\) is bad, then \\(r^{2} s\\) is also bad.\nProof. Since \\(r s\\) is bad, there is a move \\(r s \\longrightarrow x\\) for some good \\(x\\). Evidently \\(x\\) is coprime to \\(r^{2} s\\) as well, and hence the move \\(r^{2} s \\longrightarrow x\\) shows that \\(r^{2} s\\) is indeed bad.\n\nClaim 3. If \\(p>k\\) is prime and \\(n \\geqslant k\\) is bad, then \\(n p\\) is also bad.\nProof. Otherwise we choose a counterexample with \\(n\\) being as small as possible. In particular, \\(n p\\) is good. Since \\(n\\) is bad, there is a move \\(n \\longrightarrow x\\) for some good \\(x\\). Now \\(n p \\longrightarrow x\\) cannot be a valid move, which tells us that \\(x\\) has to be divisible by \\(p\\). So we can write \\(x=p^{r} y\\), where \\(r\\) and \\(y\\) denote some positive integers, the latter of which is not divisible by \\(p\\).\n\nNote that \\(y=1\\) is impossible, for then we would have \\(x=p^{r}\\) and the move \\(x \\longrightarrow k\\) would establish that \\(x\\) is bad. In view of this, there is a least power \\(y^{\\alpha}\\) of \\(y\\) that is at least as large as \\(k\\). Since the numbers \\(n p\\) and \\(y^{\\alpha}\\) are coprime and the former is good, the latter has to be bad. Moreover, the minimality of \\(\\alpha\\) implies \\(y^{\\alpha}<k y<p y=\\frac{x}{p^{r-1}}<\\frac{n}{p^{r-1}}\\). So \\(p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}<n\\) and consequently all the numbers \\(y^{\\alpha}, p y^{\\alpha}, \\ldots, p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}=p\\left(p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}\\right)\\) are bad due to the minimal choice of \\(n\\). But now by Claim 1 the divisor \\(x\\) of \\(p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}\\) cannot be good, whereby we have reached a contradiction that proves Claim 3.\n\nWe now deduce the statement of the problem from these three claims. To this end, we call two integers \\(a, b \\geqslant k\\) similar if they are divisible by the same prime numbers not exceeding \\(k\\). We are to prove that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are similar, then either both of them are good or both are bad. As in this case the product \\(a b\\) is similar to both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it suffices to show the following: if \\(c \\geqslant k\\) is similar to some of its multiples \\(d\\), then either both \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are good or both are bad.\n\nAssuming that this is not true in general, we choose a counterexample ( \\(c_{0}, d_{0}\\) ) with \\(d_{0}\\) being as small as possible. By Claim \\(1, c_{0}\\) is bad whilst \\(d_{0}\\) is good. Plainly \\(d_{0}\\) is strictly greater than \\(c_{0}\\) and hence the quotient \\(\\frac{d_{0}}{c_{0}}\\) has some prime factor \\(p\\). Clearly \\(p\\) divides \\(d_{0}\\). If \\(p \\leqslant k\\), then \\(p\\) divides \\(c_{0}\\) as well due to the similarity, and hence \\(d_{0}\\) is actually divisible by \\(p^{2}\\). So \\(\\frac{d_{0}}{p}\\) is good by the contrapositive of Claim 2. Since \\(c_{0} \\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{d_{0}}{p}\\right.\\), the pair ( \\(c_{0}, \\frac{d_{0}}{p}\\) ) contradicts the supposed minimality of \\(d_{0}\\). This proves \\(p>k\\), but now we get the same contradiction using Claim 3 instead of Claim 2. Thereby the problem is solved.\n\nSolution 2. We use the same analysis of the game of numbers as in the first five paragraphs of the first solution. Let us call a prime number \\(p\\) small in case \\(p \\leqslant k\\) and big otherwise. We again call two integers similar if their sets of small prime factors coincide.\n\nClaim 4. For each integer \\(b \\geqslant k\\) having some small prime factor, there exists an integer \\(x\\) similar to it with \\(b \\geqslant x \\geqslant k\\) and having no big prime factors.\nProof. Unless \\(b\\) has a big prime factor we may simply choose \\(x=b\\). Now let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) denote a small and a big prime factor of \\(b\\), respectively. Let \\(a\\) be the product of all small prime factors of \\(b\\). Further define \\(n\\) to be the least non-negative integer for which the number \\(x=p^{n} a\\) is at least as large as \\(k\\). It suffices to show that \\(b>x\\). This is clear in case \\(n=0\\), so let us assume \\(n>0\\) from now on. Then we have \\(x<p k\\) due to the minimality of \\(n, p \\leqslant a\\) because \\(p\\) divides \\(a\\) by construction, and \\(k<q\\). Therefore \\(x<a q\\) and, as the right hand side is a product of distinct prime factors of \\(b\\), this implies indeed \\(x<b\\).\n\nLet us now assume that there is a pair ( \\(a, b\\) ) of similar numbers such that \\(a\\) is bad and \\(b\\) is good. Take such a pair with \\(\\max (a, b)\\) being as small as possible. Since \\(a\\) is bad, there exists a move \\(a \\longrightarrow r\\) for some good \\(r\\). Since the numbers \\(k\\) and \\(r\\) are both good, they have a common prime factor, which necessarily has to be small. Thus Claim 4 is applicable to \\(r\\), which yields an integer \\(r^{\\prime}\\) similar to \\(r\\) containing small prime factors only and satisfying \\(r \\geqslant r^{\\prime} \\geqslant k\\). Since \\(\\max \\left(r, r^{\\prime}\\right)=r<a \\leqslant \\max (a, b)\\) the number \\(r^{\\prime}\\) is also good. Now let \\(p\\) denote a common prime factor of the good numbers \\(r^{\\prime}\\) and \\(b\\). By our construction of \\(r^{\\prime}\\), this prime is small and due to the similarities it consequently divides \\(a\\) and \\(r\\), contrary to \\(a \\longrightarrow r\\) being a move. Thereby the problem is solved.\n\nComment 1. Having reached Claim 4 of Solution 2, there are various other ways to proceed. For instance, one may directly obtain the following fact, which seems to be interesting in its own right:\n\nClaim 5. Any two good numbers have a common small prime factor.\nProof. Otherwise there exists a pair \\(\\left(b, b^{\\prime}\\right)\\) of good numbers with \\(b^{\\prime} \\geqslant b \\geqslant k\\) all of whose common prime factors are big. Choose such a pair with \\(b^{\\prime}\\) being as small as possible. Since \\(b\\) and \\(k\\) are both good, there has to be a common prime factor \\(p\\) of \\(b\\) and \\(k\\). Evidently \\(p\\) is small and thus it cannot divide \\(b^{\\prime}\\), which in turn tells us \\(b^{\\prime}>b\\). Applying Claim 4 to \\(b\\) we get an integer \\(x\\) with \\(b \\geqslant x \\geqslant k\\) that is similar to \\(b\\) and has no big prime divisors at all. By our assumption, \\(b^{\\prime}\\) and \\(x\\) are coprime, and as \\(b^{\\prime}\\) is good this implies that \\(x\\) is bad. Consequently there has to be some move \\(x \\longrightarrow b^{*}\\) such that \\(b^{*}\\) is good. But now all the small prime factors of \\(b\\) also appear in \\(x\\) and thus they cannot divide \\(b^{*}\\). Therefore the pair \\(\\left(b^{*}, b\\right)\\) contradicts the supposed minimality of \\(b^{\\prime}\\).\n\nFrom that point, it is easy to complete the solution: assume that there are two similar integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a\\) is bad and \\(b\\) is good. Since \\(a\\) is bad, there is a move \\(a \\longrightarrow b^{\\prime}\\) for some good \\(b^{\\prime}\\). By Claim 5, there is a small prime \\(p\\) dividing \\(b\\) and \\(b^{\\prime}\\). Due to the similarity of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the prime \\(p\\) has to divide \\(a\\) as well, but this contradicts the fact that \\(a \\longrightarrow b^{\\prime}\\) is a valid move. Thereby the problem is solved.\n\nComment 2. There are infinitely many good numbers, e.g. all multiples of \\(k\\). The increasing sequence \\(b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots\\), of all good numbers may be constructed recursively as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Start with \\(b_{0}=k\\).\n  \\item If \\(b_{n}\\) has just been defined for some \\(n \\geqslant 0\\), then \\(b_{n+1}\\) is the smallest number \\(b>b_{n}\\) that is coprime to none of \\(b_{0}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\).\n\n\nThis construction can be used to determine the set of good numbers for any specific \\(k\\) as explained in the next comment. It is already clear that if \\(k=p^{\\alpha}\\) is a prime power, then a number \\(b \\geqslant k\\) is good if and only if it is divisible by \\(p\\).\n\nComment 3. Let \\(P>1\\) denote the product of all small prime numbers. Then any two integers \\(a, b \\geqslant k\\) that are congruent modulo \\(P\\) are similar. Thus the infinite word \\(W_{k}=\\left(X_{k}, X_{k+1}, \\ldots\\right)\\) defined by\n\n\\[\nX_{i}= \\begin{cases}A & \\text { if } i \\text { is bad } \\\\ B & \\text { if } i \\text { is good }\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(i \\geqslant k\\) is periodic and the length of its period divides \\(P\\). As the prime power example shows, the true period can sometimes be much smaller than \\(P\\). On the other hand, there are cases where the period is rather large; e.g., if \\(k=15\\), the sequence of good numbers begins with \\(15,18,20,24,30,36,40,42,45\\) and the period of \\(W_{15}\\) is 30 .\n\nComment 4. The original proposal contained two questions about the game of numbers, namely (a) to show that if two numbers have the same prime factors then either both are good or both are bad, and (b) to show that the word \\(W_{k}\\) introduced in the previous comment is indeed periodic. The Problem Selection Committee thinks that the above version of the problem is somewhat easier, even though it demands to prove a stronger result."}

One can check similarly that the ceiling function has the same property.\nII. Let us now suppose conversely that the function \\(f: \\mathbb{Q} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}\\) satisfies (1) for all \\((x, a, b) \\in\\) \\(\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\). According to the behaviour of the restriction of \\(f\\) to the integers we distinguish two cases.\n\nCase 1: There is some \\(m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(f(m) \\neq m\\).\nWrite \\(f(m)=C\\) and let \\(\\eta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}\\) and \\(b\\) denote the sign and absolute value of \\(f(m)-m\\), respectively. Given any integer \\(r\\), we may plug the triple ( \\(m, r b-C, b\\) ) into (1), thus getting \\(f(r)=f(r-\\eta)\\). Starting with \\(m\\) and using induction in both directions, we deduce from this that the equation \\(f(r)=C\\) holds for all integers \\(r\\). Now any rational number \\(y\\) can be written in the form \\(y=\\frac{p}{q}\\) with \\((p, q) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), and substituting \\((C-p, p-C, q)\\) into \\((1)\\) we get \\(f(y)=f(0)=C\\). Thus \\(f\\) is the constant function whose value is always \\(C\\).\n\nCase 2: One has \\(f(m)=m\\) for all integers \\(m\\).\nNote that now the special case \\(b=1\\) of (1) takes a particularly simple form, namely\n\n\\[\nf(x)+a=f(x+a) \\quad \\text { for all }(x, a) \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nDefining \\(f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\omega\\) we proceed in three steps.\nStep A. We show that \\(\\omega \\in\\{0,1\\}\\).\nIf \\(\\omega \\leqslant 0\\), we may plug \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},-\\omega, 1-2 \\omega\\right)\\) into (1), obtaining \\(0=f(0)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\omega\\). In the contrary case \\(\\omega \\geqslant 1\\) we argue similarly using the triple \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\omega-1,2 \\omega-1\\right)\\).\n\nStep B. We show that \\(f(x)=\\omega\\) for all rational numbers \\(x\\) with \\(0<x<1\\).\nAssume that this fails and pick some rational number \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\in(0,1)\\) with minimal \\(b\\) such that \\(f\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\neq \\omega\\). Obviously, \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1\\) and \\(b \\geqslant 2\\). If \\(b\\) is even, then \\(a\\) has to be odd and we can substitute \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{a-1}{2}, \\frac{b}{2}\\right)\\) into (1), which yields\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\omega+(a-1) / 2}{b / 2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\neq \\omega\n\\]\n\nRecall that \\(0 \\leqslant(a-1) / 2<b / 2\\). Thus, in both cases \\(\\omega=0\\) and \\(\\omega=1\\), the left-hand part of (3) equals \\(\\omega\\) either by the minimality of \\(b\\), or by \\(f(\\omega)=\\omega\\). A contradiction.\n\nThus \\(b\\) has to be odd, so \\(b=2 k+1\\) for some \\(k \\geqslant 1\\). Applying (1) to \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, k, b\\right)\\) we get\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\omega+k}{b}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\omega\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime, there exist integers \\(r \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, b\\}\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(r a-m b=k+\\omega\\). Note that we actually have \\(1 \\leqslant r<b\\), since the right hand side is not a multiple of \\(b\\). If \\(m\\) is negative, then we have \\(r a-m b>b \\geqslant k+\\omega\\), which is absurd. Similarly, \\(m \\geqslant r\\) leads to \\(r a-m b<b r-b r=0\\), which is likewise impossible; so we must have \\(0 \\leqslant m \\leqslant r-1\\).\n\nWe finally substitute \\(\\left(\\frac{k+\\omega}{b}, m, r\\right)\\) into (1) and use (4) to learn\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{\\omega+m}{r}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\neq \\omega\n\\]\n\nBut as above one may see that the left hand side has to equal \\(\\omega\\) due to the minimality of \\(b\\). This contradiction concludes our step B.\n\nStep \\(C\\). Now notice that if \\(\\omega=0\\), then \\(f(x)=\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\) holds for all rational \\(x\\) with \\(0 \\leqslant x<1\\) and hence by (2) this even holds for all rational numbers \\(x\\). Similarly, if \\(\\omega=1\\), then \\(f(x)=\\lceil x\\rceil\\) holds for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Thereby the problem is solved.\n\nComment 1. An alternative treatment of Steps B and C from the second case, due to the proposer, proceeds as follows. Let square brackets indicate the floor function in case \\(\\omega=0\\) and the ceiling function if \\(\\omega=1\\). We are to prove that \\(f(x)=[x]\\) holds for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), and because of Step A and (2) we already know this in case \\(2 x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Applying (1) to ( \\(2 x, 0,2\\) ) we get\n\n\\[\nf(x)=f\\left(\\frac{f(2 x)}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nand by the previous observation this yields\n\n\\[\nf(x)=\\left[\\frac{f(2 x)}{2}\\right] \\quad \\text { for all } x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\n\\]\n\nAn easy induction now shows\n\n\\[\nf(x)=\\left[\\frac{f\\left(2^{n} x\\right)}{2^{n}}\\right] \\quad \\text { for all }(x, n) \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\n\\]\n\nNow suppose first that \\(x\\) is not an integer but can be written in the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) with \\(p \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\) both being odd. Let \\(d\\) denote the multiplicative order of 2 modulo \\(q\\) and let \\(m\\) be any large integer. Plugging \\(n=d m\\) into (6) and using (2) we get\n\n\\[\nf(x)=\\left[\\frac{f\\left(2^{d m} x\\right)}{2^{d m}}\\right]=\\left[\\frac{f(x)+\\left(2^{d m}-1\\right) x}{2^{d m}}\\right]=\\left[x+\\frac{f(x)-x}{2^{d m}}\\right]\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) is not an integer, the square bracket function is continuous at \\(x\\); hence as \\(m\\) tends to infinity the above fomula gives \\(f(x)=[x]\\). To complete the argument we just need to observe that if some \\(y \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) satisfies \\(f(y)=[y]\\), then (5) yields \\(f\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{[y]}{2}\\right)=\\left[\\frac{[y]}{2}\\right]=\\left[\\frac{y}{2}\\right]\\).\n\nSolution 2. Here we just give another argument for the second case of the above solution. Again we use equation (2). It follows that the set \\(S\\) of all zeros of \\(f\\) contains for each \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) exactly one term from the infinite sequence \\(\\ldots, x-2, x-1, x, x+1, x+2, \\ldots\\).\n\nNext we claim that\n\n\\[\n\\text { if }(p, q) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\text { and } \\frac{p}{q} \\in S, \\text { then } \\frac{p}{q+1} \\in S \\text { holds as well. }\n\\]\n\nTo see this we just plug \\(\\left(\\frac{p}{q}, p, q+1\\right)\\) into (1), thus getting \\(f\\left(\\frac{p}{q+1}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)=0\\).\nFrom this we get that\n\n\\[\n\\text { if } x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}, x>y>0, \\text { and } x \\in S, \\text { then } y \\in S .\n\\]\n\nIndeed, if we write \\(x=\\frac{p}{q}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{r}{s}\\) with \\(p, q, r, s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), then \\(p s>q r\\) and (7) tells us\n\n\\[\n0=f\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{p r}{q r}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{p r}{q r+1}\\right)=\\ldots=f\\left(\\frac{p r}{p s}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{r}{s}\\right)\n\\]\n\nEssentially the same argument also establishes that\n\n\\[\n\\text { if } x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}, x<y<0, \\text { and } x \\in S, \\text { then } y \\in S .\n\\]\n\nFrom (8) and (9) we get \\(0 \\in S \\subseteq(-1,+1)\\) and hence the real number \\(\\alpha=\\sup (S)\\) exists and satisfies \\(0 \\leqslant \\alpha \\leqslant 1\\).\n\nLet us assume that we actually had \\(0<\\alpha<1\\). Note that \\(f(x)=0\\) if \\(x \\in(0, \\alpha) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\) by (8), and \\(f(x)=1\\) if \\(x \\in(\\alpha, 1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\) by (9) and (2). Let \\(K\\) denote the unique positive integer satisfying \\(K \\alpha<1 \\leqslant(K+1) \\alpha\\). The first of these two inequalities entails \\(\\alpha<\\frac{1+\\alpha}{K+1}\\), and thus there is a rational number \\(x \\in\\left(\\alpha, \\frac{1+\\alpha}{K+1}\\right)\\). Setting \\(y=(K+1) x-1\\) and substituting ( \\(y, 1, K+1\\) ) into (1) we learn\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{f(y)+1}{K+1}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{y+1}{K+1}\\right)=f(x)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\alpha<x<1\\) and \\(0<y<\\alpha\\), this simplifies to\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{K+1}\\right)=1\n\\]\n\nBut, as \\(0<\\frac{1}{K+1} \\leqslant \\alpha\\), this is only possible if \\(\\alpha=\\frac{1}{K+1}\\) and \\(f(\\alpha)=1\\). From this, however, we get the contradiction\n\n\\[\n0=f\\left(\\frac{1}{(K+1)^{2}}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+0}{K+1}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{f(\\alpha)+0}{K+1}\\right)=f(\\alpha)=1 .\n\\]\n\nThus our assumption \\(0<\\alpha<1\\) has turned out to be wrong and it follows that \\(\\alpha \\in\\{0,1\\}\\). If \\(\\alpha=0\\), then we have \\(S \\subseteq(-1,0]\\), whence \\(S=(-1,0] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\), which in turn yields \\(f(x)=\\lceil x\\rceil\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) due to (2). Similarly, \\(\\alpha=1\\) entails \\(S=[0,1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(f(x)=\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Thereby the solution is complete.\n\nComment 2. It seems that all solutions to this problems involve some case distinction separating the constant solutions from the unbounded ones, though the \"descriptions\" of the cases may be different depending on the work that has been done at the beginning of the solution. For instance, these two cases can also be \" \\(f\\) is periodic on the integers\" and \" \\(f\\) is not periodic on the integers\". The case leading to the unbounded solutions appears to be the harder one.\n\nIn most approaches, the cases leading to the two functions \\(x \\longmapsto\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\) and \\(x \\longmapsto\\lceil x\\rceil\\) can easily be treated parallelly, but sometimes it may be useful to know that there is some symmetry in the problem interchanging these two functions. Namely, if a function \\(f: \\mathbb{Q} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}\\) satisfies (1), then so does the function \\(g: \\mathbb{Q} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}\\) defined by \\(g(x)=-f(-x)\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). For that reason, we could have restricted our attention to the case \\(\\omega=0\\) in the first solution and, once \\(\\alpha \\in\\{0,1\\}\\) had been obtained, to the case \\(\\alpha=0\\) in the second solution."}

If \\(\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\}<1\\), then we have \\(\\lfloor(a+b) \\nu\\rfloor=\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor\\) and \\(\\lceil(a+b) \\nu\\rceil=\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-1\\), so\n\n\\[\nf(a+b, b)=(a+b)\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-b(\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(a, b+a)=a(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1)-(b+a)\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor=f(a, b)+a(\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1-\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, if \\(\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\} \\geqslant 1\\) then one obtains\n\n\\[\nf(a+b, b)=f(a, b) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)+a\n\\]\n\nSo, in both cases one of the numbers \\(f(a+b, a)\\) and \\(f(a, b+a)\\) is equal to \\(f(a, b)\\) while the other is greater than \\(f(a, b)\\) by one of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Thus, exactly one of the pairs \\((a+b, b)\\) and \\((a, b+a)\\) is excellent (for an appropriate value of \\(m\\) ).\n\nNow let us say that the pairs \\((a+b, b)\\) and \\((a, b+a)\\) are the children of the pair \\((a, b)\\), while this pair is their parent. Next, if a pair \\((c, d)\\) can be obtained from \\((a, b)\\) by several passings from a parent to a child, we will say that \\((c, d)\\) is a descendant of \\((a, b)\\), while \\((a, b)\\) is an ancestor of \\((c, d)\\) (a pair is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of itself). Thus each pair ( \\(a, b\\) ) has two children, it has a unique parent if \\(a \\neq b\\), and no parents otherwise. Therefore, each pair of distinct positive integers has a unique ancestor of the form ( \\(a, a\\) ); our aim is now to find how many \\(m\\)-excellent descendants each such pair has.\n\nNotice now that if a pair \\((a, b)\\) is \\(m\\)-excellent then \\(\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m\\). Indeed, if \\(a=b\\) then \\(f(a, a)=a=m\\), so the statement is valid. Otherwise, the pair \\((a, b)\\) is a child of some pair \\(\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)\\). If \\(b=b^{\\prime}\\) and \\(a=a^{\\prime}+b^{\\prime}\\), then we should have \\(m=f(a, b)=f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)+b^{\\prime}\\), so \\(b=b^{\\prime}=m-f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)<m\\). Similarly, if \\(a=a^{\\prime}\\) and \\(b=b^{\\prime}+a^{\\prime}\\) then \\(a<m\\).\n\nLet us consider the set \\(S_{m}\\) of all pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(f(a, b) \\leqslant m\\) and \\(\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m\\). Then all the ancestors of the elements in \\(S_{m}\\) are again in \\(S_{m}\\), and each element in \\(S_{m}\\) either is of the form ( \\(a, a\\) ) with \\(a \\leqslant m\\), or has a unique ancestor of this form. From the arguments above we see that all \\(m\\)-excellent pairs lie in \\(S_{m}\\).\n\nWe claim now that the set \\(S_{m}\\) is finite. Indeed, assume, for instance, that it contains infinitely many pairs \\((c, d)\\) with \\(d>2 m\\). Such a pair is necessarily a child of \\((c, d-c)\\), and thus a descendant of some pair ( \\(c, d^{\\prime}\\) ) with \\(m<d^{\\prime} \\leqslant 2 m\\). Therefore, one of the pairs ( \\(a, b\\) ) \\(\\in S_{m}\\) with \\(m<b \\leqslant 2 m\\)\nhas infinitely many descendants in \\(S_{m}\\), and all these descendants have the form ( \\(a, b+k a\\) ) with \\(k\\) a positive integer. Since \\(f(a, b+k a)\\) does not decrease as \\(k\\) grows, it becomes constant for \\(k \\geqslant k_{0}\\), where \\(k_{0}\\) is some positive integer. This means that \\(\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}<1\\) for all \\(k \\geqslant k_{0}\\). But this yields \\(1>\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}=\\left\\{\\left(b+k_{0} a\\right) \\nu\\right\\}+\\left(k-k_{0}\\right)\\{a \\nu\\}\\) for all \\(k>k_{0}\\), which is absurd.\n\nSimilarly, one can prove that \\(S_{m}\\) contains finitely many pairs ( \\(c, d\\) ) with \\(c>2 m\\), thus finitely many elements at all.\n\nWe are now prepared for proving the following crucial lemma.\nLemma. Consider any pair \\((a, b)\\) with \\(f(a, b) \\neq m\\). Then the number \\(g(a, b)\\) of its \\(m\\)-excellent descendants is equal to the number \\(h(a, b)\\) of ways to represent the number \\(t=m-f(a, b)\\) as \\(t=k a+\\ell b\\) with \\(k\\) and \\(\\ell\\) being some nonnegative integers.\nProof. We proceed by induction on the number \\(N\\) of descendants of ( \\(a, b\\) ) in \\(S_{m}\\). If \\(N=0\\) then clearly \\(g(a, b)=0\\). Assume that \\(h(a, b)>0\\); without loss of generality, we have \\(a \\leqslant b\\). Then, clearly, \\(m-f(a, b) \\geqslant a\\), so \\(f(a, b+a) \\leqslant f(a, b)+a \\leqslant m\\) and \\(a \\leqslant m\\), hence \\((a, b+a) \\in S_{m}\\) which is impossible. Thus in the base case we have \\(g(a, b)=h(a, b)=0\\), as desired.\n\nNow let \\(N>0\\). Assume that \\(f(a+b, b)=f(a, b)+b\\) and \\(f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)\\) (the other case is similar). If \\(f(a, b)+b \\neq m\\), then by the induction hypothesis we have\n\n\\[\ng(a, b)=g(a+b, b)+g(a, b+a)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)\n\\]\n\nNotice that both pairs \\((a+b, b)\\) and \\((a, b+a)\\) are descendants of \\((a, b)\\) and thus each of them has strictly less descendants in \\(S_{m}\\) than ( \\(a, b\\) ) does.\n\nNext, each one of the \\(h(a+b, b)\\) representations of \\(m-f(a+b, b)=m-b-f(a, b)\\) as the sum \\(k^{\\prime}(a+b)+\\ell^{\\prime} b\\) provides the representation \\(m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b\\) with \\(k=k^{\\prime}<k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime}+1=\\ell\\). Similarly, each one of the \\(h(a, b+a)\\) representations of \\(m-f(a, b+a)=m-f(a, b)\\) as the sum \\(k^{\\prime} a+\\ell^{\\prime}(b+a)\\) provides the representation \\(m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b\\) with \\(k=k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime} \\geqslant \\ell^{\\prime}=\\ell\\). This correspondence is obviously bijective, so\n\n\\[\nh(a, b)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)=g(a, b),\n\\]\n\nas required.\nFinally, if \\(f(a, b)+b=m\\) then \\((a+b, b)\\) is \\(m\\)-excellent, so \\(g(a, b)=1+g(a, b+a)=1+h(a, b+a)\\) by the induction hypothesis. On the other hand, the number \\(m-f(a, b)=b\\) has a representation \\(0 \\cdot a+1 \\cdot b\\) and sometimes one more representation as \\(k a+0 \\cdot b\\); this last representation exists simultaneously with the representation \\(m-f(a, b+a)=k a+0 \\cdot(b+a)\\), so \\(h(a, b)=1+h(a, b+a)\\) as well. Thus in this case the step is also proved.\n\nNow it is easy to finish the solution. There exists a unique \\(m\\)-excellent pair of the form \\((a, a)\\), and each other \\(m\\)-excellent pair \\((a, b)\\) has a unique ancestor of the form \\((x, x)\\) with \\(x<m\\). By the lemma, for every \\(x<m\\) the number of its \\(m\\)-excellent descendants is \\(h(x, x)\\), which is the number of ways to represent \\(m-f(x, x)=m-x\\) as \\(k x+\\ell x\\) (with nonnegative integer \\(k\\) and \\(\\ell\\) ). This number is 0 if \\(x \\nmid m\\), and \\(m / x\\) otherwise. So the total number of excellent pairs is\n\n\\[\n1+\\sum_{x \\mid m, x<m} \\frac{m}{x}=1+\\sum_{d \\mid m, d>1} d=\\sum_{d \\mid m} d,\n\\]\n\nas required.\n\nComment. Let us present a sketch of an outline of a different solution. The plan is to check that the number of excellent pairs does not depend on the (irrational) number \\(\\nu\\), and to find this number for some appropriate value of \\(\\nu\\). For that, we first introduce some geometrical language. We deal only with the excellent pairs \\((a, b)\\) with \\(a \\neq b\\).\n\nPart I. Given an irrational positive \\(\\nu\\), for every positive integer \\(n\\) we introduce two integral points \\(F_{\\nu}(n)=\\) \\((n,\\lfloor n \\nu\\rfloor)\\) and \\(C_{\\nu}(n)=(n,\\lceil n \\nu\\rceil)\\) on the coordinate plane \\(O x y\\). Then (*) reads as \\(\\left[O F_{\\nu}(a) C_{\\nu}(b)\\right]=m / 2\\); here \\([\\cdot]\\) stands for the signed area. Next, we rewrite in these terms the condition on a pair \\((a, b)\\) to be excellent. Let \\(\\ell_{\\nu}, \\ell_{\\nu}^{+}\\), and \\(\\ell_{\\nu}^{-}\\)be the lines determined by the equations \\(y=\\nu x, y=\\nu x+1\\), and \\(y=\\nu x-1\\), respectively.\n\\(a\\) ). Firstly, we deal with all excellent pairs ( \\(a, b\\) ) with \\(a<b\\). Given some value of \\(a\\), all the points \\(C\\) such that \\(\\left[O F_{\\nu}(a) C\\right]=m / 2\\) lie on some line \\(f_{\\nu}(a)\\); if there exist any good pairs ( \\(a, b\\) ) at all, this line has to contain at least one integral point, which happens exactly when \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor) \\mid m\\).\n\nLet \\(P_{\\nu}(a)\\) be the point of intersection of \\(\\ell_{\\nu}^{+}\\)and \\(f_{\\nu}(a)\\), and let \\(p_{\\nu}(a)\\) be its abscissa; notice that \\(p_{\\nu}(a)\\) is irrational if it is nonzero. Now, if ( \\(a, b\\) ) is good, then the point \\(C_{\\nu}(b)\\) lies on \\(f_{\\nu}(a)\\), which means that the point of \\(f_{\\nu}(a)\\) with abscissa \\(b\\) lies between \\(\\ell_{\\nu}\\) and \\(\\ell_{\\nu}^{+}\\)and is integral. If in addition the pair \\((a, b-a)\\) is not good, then the point of \\(f_{\\nu}(a)\\) with abscissa \\(b-a\\) lies above \\(\\ell_{\\nu}^{+}\\)(see Fig. 1). Thus, the pair \\((a, b)\\) with \\(b>a\\) is excellent exactly when \\(p_{\\nu}(a)\\) lies between \\(b-a\\) and \\(b\\), and the point of \\(f_{\\nu}(a)\\) with abscissa \\(b\\) is integral (which means that this point is \\(C_{\\nu}(b)\\) ).\n\nNotice now that, if \\(p_{\\nu}(a)>a\\), then the number of excellent pairs of the form ( \\(a, b\\) ) (with \\(b>a\\) ) is \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a,\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor)\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-67}\n\nFigure 1\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_f5ba16bf9d53675b385ag-67(1)}\n\nFigure 2\n\\(b)\\). Analogously, considering the pairs ( \\(a, b\\) ) with \\(a>b\\), we fix the value of \\(b\\), introduce the line \\(c_{\\nu}(b)\\) containing all the points \\(F\\) with \\(\\left[O F C_{\\nu}(b)\\right]=m / 2\\), assume that this line contains an integral point (which means \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(b,[b \\nu]) \\mid m\\) ), and denote the common point of \\(c_{\\nu}(b)\\) and \\(\\ell_{\\nu}^{-}\\)by \\(Q_{\\nu}(b)\\), its abscissa being \\(q_{\\nu}(b)\\). Similarly to the previous case, we obtain that the pair ( \\(a, b\\) ) is excellent exactly when \\(q_{\\nu}(a)\\) lies between \\(a-b\\) and \\(a\\), and the point of \\(c_{\\nu}(b)\\) with abscissa \\(a\\) is integral (see Fig. 2). Again, if \\(q_{\\nu}(b)>b\\), then the number of excellent pairs of the form ( \\(a, b\\) ) (with \\(a>b\\) ) is \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(b,\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil)\\).\nPart II, sketchy. Having obtained such a description, one may check how the number of excellent pairs changes as \\(\\nu\\) grows. (Having done that, one may find this number for one appropriate value of \\(\\nu\\); for instance, it is relatively easy to make this calculation for \\(\\nu \\in\\left(1,1+\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\).)\n\nConsider, for the initial value of \\(\\nu\\), some excellent pair \\((a, t)\\) with \\(a>t\\). As \\(\\nu\\) grows, this pair eventually stops being excellent; this happens when the point \\(Q_{\\nu}(t)\\) passes through \\(F_{\\nu}(a)\\). At the same moment, the pair ( \\(a+t, t\\) ) becomes excellent instead.\n\nThis process halts when the point \\(Q_{\\nu}(t)\\) eventually disappears, i.e. when \\(\\nu\\) passes through the ratio of the coordinates of the point \\(T=C_{\\nu}(t)\\). Hence, the point \\(T\\) afterwards is regarded as \\(F_{\\nu}(t)\\). Thus, all the old excellent pairs of the form ( \\(a, t\\) ) with \\(a>t\\) disappear; on the other hand, the same number of excellent pairs with the first element being \\(t\\) just appear.\n\nSimilarly, if some pair \\((t, b)\\) with \\(t<b\\) is initially \\(\\nu\\)-excellent, then at some moment it stops being excellent when \\(P_{\\nu}(t)\\) passes through \\(C_{\\nu}(b)\\); at the same moment, the pair \\((t, b-t)\\) becomes excellent. This process eventually stops when \\(b-t<t\\). At this moment, again the second element of the pair becomes fixed, and the first one starts to increase.\n\nThese ideas can be made precise enough to show that the number of excellent pairs remains unchanged, as required.\n\nWe should warn the reader that the rigorous elaboration of Part II is technically quite involved, mostly by the reason that the set of moments when the collection of excellent pairs changes is infinite. Especially much care should be applied to the limit points of this set, which are exactly the points when the line \\(\\ell_{\\nu}\\) passes through some point of the form \\(C_{\\nu}(b)\\).\n\nThe same ideas may be explained in an algebraic language instead of a geometrical one; the same technicalities remain in this way as well."}

Therefore, \\(M_{n+1}=M_{n}\\) and \\(m_{n+1} \\leqslant 2 M_{n}=2 M_{n+1}\\). So, the index \\(n+1\\) is also lucky, and \\(M_{n+1}=M_{n}\\).

We need to prove that both are bounded.\nConsider an arbitrary \\(n>2 D\\); our first aim is to bound \\(a_{n}\\) in terms of \\(m_{i}\\) and \\(M_{i}\\). Set \\(k=\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor\\).\n(i) Choose indices \\(p, q\\), and \\(r\\) such that \\(a_{n}=-\\left(a_{p}+a_{q}+a_{r}\\right)\\) and \\(p+q+r=n\\). Without loss of generality, \\(p \\geqslant q \\geqslant r\\).\n\nAssume that \\(p \\geqslant k+1(>D)\\); then \\(p>q+r\\). Hence\n\n\\[\n-a_{p}=\\max _{i_{1}+i_{2}+i_{3}=p}\\left(a_{i_{1}}+a_{i_{2}}+a_{i_{3}}\\right) \\geqslant a_{q}+a_{r}+a_{p-q-r}\n\\]\n\nand therefore \\(a_{n}=-\\left(a_{p}+a_{q}+a_{r}\\right) \\geqslant\\left(a_{q}+a_{r}+a_{p-q-r}\\right)-a_{q}-a_{r}=a_{p-q-r} \\geqslant-m_{n}\\).\nOtherwise, we have \\(k \\geqslant p \\geqslant q \\geqslant r\\).

Then \\(a_{p}, a_{q} \\leqslant M_{k+1}\\) and \\(a_{r} \\leqslant M_{k}\\), whence \\(a_{n} \\geqslant-2 M_{k+1}-M_{k}\\).\n\nThus, in any case \\(a_{n} \\geqslant-\\max \\left\\{m_{n}, 2 M_{k+1}+M_{k}\\right\\}\\).\n(ii) On the other hand, choose \\(p \\leqslant k\\) and \\(q \\leqslant k-1\\) such that \\(a_{p}=M_{k+1}\\) and \\(a_{q}=M_{k}\\). Then \\(p+q<n\\), so \\(a_{n} \\leqslant-\\left(a_{p}+a_{q}+a_{n-p-q}\\right)=-a_{n-p-q}-M_{k+1}-M_{k} \\leqslant m_{n}-M_{k+1}-M_{k}\\).\n\nTo summarize,\n\n\\[\n-\\max \\left\\{m_{n}, 2 M_{k+1}+M_{k}\\right\\} \\leqslant a_{n} \\leqslant m_{n}-M_{k+1}-M_{k},\n\\]\n\nwhence\n\n\\[\nm_{n} \\leqslant m_{n+1} \\leqslant \\max \\left\\{m_{n}, 2 M_{k+1}+M_{k}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad M_{n} \\leqslant M_{n+1} \\leqslant \\max \\left\\{M_{n}, m_{n}-M_{k+1}-M_{k}\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nNow, say that an index \\(n>2 D\\) is lucky if \\(m_{n} \\leqslant 2 M_{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor+1}+M_{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}\\). Two cases are possible.\nCase 1. Assume that there exists a lucky index \\(n\\); set \\(k=\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor\\). In this case, (4) yields \\(m_{n+1} \\leqslant\\) \\(2 M_{k+1}+M_{k}\\) and \\(M_{n} \\leqslant M_{n+1} \\leqslant M_{n}\\) (the last relation holds, since \\(m_{n}-M_{k+1}-M_{k} \\leqslant\\left(2 M_{k+1}+\\right.\\) \\(\\left.\\left.M_{k}\\right)-M_{k+1}-M_{k}=M_{k+1} \\leqslant M_{n}\\right)\\). Therefore, \\(M_{n+1}=M_{n}\\) and \\(m_{n+1} \\leqslant 2 M_{k+1}+M_{k}\\); the last relation shows that the index \\(n+1\\) is also lucky.\n\nThus, all indices \\(N>n\\) are lucky, and \\(M_{N}=M_{n} \\geqslant m_{N} / 3\\), whence all the \\(m_{N}\\) and \\(M_{N}\\) are bounded by \\(3 M_{n}\\).\nCase 2. Conversely, assume that there is no lucky index, i.e., \\(2 M_{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor+1}+M_{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}<m_{n}\\) for all \\(n>2 D\\). Then (4) shows that for all \\(n>2 D\\) we have \\(m_{n} \\leqslant m_{n+1} \\leqslant m_{n}\\), i.e., \\(m_{N}=m_{2 D+1}\\) for all \\(N>2 D\\). Since \\(M_{N}<m_{2 N+1} / 3\\) for all such indices, all the \\(m_{N}\\) and \\(M_{N}\\) are bounded by \\(m_{2 D+1}\\).\n\nThus, in both cases the sequences \\(\\left(m_{n}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(M_{n}\\right)\\) are bounded, as desired.\nVersion 2. Let \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots\\) be a sequence of numbers that satisfies the relation\n\n\\[\na_{n}=-\\max _{i_{1}+\\cdots+i_{k}=n}\\left(a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{k}}\\right) \\quad \\text { for all } n>2017 .\n\\]\n\nThen, this sequence is bounded.\nProof. As in the solutions above, let \\(D=2017\\). If the sequence is bounded above, say, by \\(Q\\), then we have that \\(a_{n} \\geqslant \\min \\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{D},-k Q\\right\\}\\) for all \\(n\\), so the sequence is bounded. Assume for sake of contradiction that the sequence is not bounded above. Let \\(\\ell=\\min \\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{D}\\right\\}\\), and \\(L=\\max \\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{D}\\right\\}\\). Call an index \\(n\\) good if the following criteria hold:\n\n\\[\na_{n}>a_{i} \\text { for each } i<n, \\quad a_{n}>-k \\ell, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad n>D\n\\]\n\nWe first show that there must be some good index \\(n\\). By assumption, we may take an index \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{N}>\\max \\{L,-k \\ell\\}\\). Choose \\(n\\) minimally such that \\(a_{n}=\\max \\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{N}\\right\\}\\). Now, the first condition is satisfied because of the minimality of \\(n\\), and the second and third conditions are satisfied because \\(a_{n} \\geqslant a_{N}>L,-k \\ell\\), and \\(L \\geqslant a_{i}\\) for every \\(i\\) such that \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant D\\).\n\nLet \\(n\\) be a good index. We derive a contradiction. We have that\n\n\\[\na_{n}+a_{v_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{v_{k}} \\leqslant 0\n\\]\n\nwhenever \\(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{k}=n\\).\nWe define the sequence of indices \\(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\) to greedily maximize \\(a_{v_{1}}\\), then \\(a_{v_{2}}\\), and so forth, selecting only from indices such that the equation \\(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{k}=n\\) can be satisfied by positive integers \\(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k}\\). More formally, we define them inductively so that the following criteria are satisfied by the \\(v_{i}\\) :\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\(1 \\leqslant v_{i} \\leqslant n-(k-i)-\\left(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{i-1}\\right)\\).\n  \\item \\(a_{v_{i}}\\) is maximal among all choices of \\(v_{i}\\) from the first criteria.\n\n\nFirst of all, we note that for each \\(i\\), the first criteria is always satisfiable by some \\(v_{i}\\), because we are guaranteed that\n\n\\[\nv_{i-1} \\leqslant n-(k-(i-1))-\\left(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{i-2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhich implies\n\n\\[\n1 \\leqslant n-(k-i)-\\left(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{i-1}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSecondly, the sum \\(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{k-1}\\) is at most \\(n-1\\). Define \\(v_{k}=n-\\left(v_{1}+\\cdots+v_{k-1}\\right)\\). Then, (6) is satisfied by the \\(v_{i}\\). We also note that \\(a_{v_{i}} \\geqslant a_{v_{j}}\\) for all \\(i<j\\); otherwise, in the definition of \\(v_{i}\\), we could have selected \\(v_{j}\\) instead.\n\nAssume first that \\(v_{k} \\leqslant D\\). Then, from (6), we have that\n\n\\[\na_{n}+k \\ell \\leqslant 0\n\\]\n\nby using that \\(a_{v_{1}} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant a_{v_{k}} \\geqslant \\ell\\). But this contradicts our assumption that \\(a_{n}>-k \\ell\\) in the second criteria of (5).\n\nNow assume that \\(v_{k}>D\\), and then we must have some indices \\(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{k}\\) summing up to \\(v_{k}\\) such that\n\n\\[\na_{v_{k}}+a_{w_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{w_{k}}=0\n\\]\n\nBut combining this with (6), we have\n\n\\[\na_{n}+a_{v_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{v_{k-1}} \\leqslant a_{w_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{w_{k}}\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(a_{n}>a_{v_{1}} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant a_{v_{k-1}}\\), we have that \\(\\max \\left\\{a_{w_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{w_{k}}\\right\\}>a_{v_{k-1}}\\).

Prove that for any chameleon \\(X\\), there exists a chameleon \\(Y\\) such that \\(X\\) cannot be changed to \\(Y\\) using fewer than \\(3 n^{2} / 2\\) swaps.\n(Australia)", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2017, "solution": "To start, notice that the swap of two identical letters does not change a chameleon, so we may assume there are no such swaps.\n\nFor any two chameleons \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), define their distance \\(d(X, Y)\\) to be the minimal number of swaps needed to transform \\(X\\) into \\(Y\\) (or vice versa). Clearly, \\(d(X, Y)+d(Y, Z) \\geqslant d(X, Z)\\) for any three chameleons \\(X, Y\\), and \\(Z\\).\nLemma. Consider two chameleons\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_c0af87966e053f440e8cg-37}\n\nThen \\(d(P, Q) \\geqslant 3 n^{2}\\).\nProof. For any chameleon \\(X\\) and any pair of distinct letters \\(u, v \\in\\{a, b, c\\}\\), we define \\(f_{u, v}(X)\\) to be the number of pairs of positions in \\(X\\) such that the left one is occupied by \\(u\\), and the right one is occupied by \\(v\\). Define \\(f(X)=f_{a, b}(X)+f_{a, c}(X)+f_{b, c}(X)\\). Notice that \\(f_{a, b}(P)=f_{a, c}(P)=f_{b, c}(P)=n^{2}\\) and \\(f_{a, b}(Q)=f_{a, c}(Q)=f_{b, c}(Q)=0\\), so \\(f(P)=3 n^{2}\\) and \\(f(Q)=0\\).\n\nNow consider some swap changing a chameleon \\(X\\) to \\(X^{\\prime}\\); say, the letters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are swapped. Then \\(f_{a, b}(X)\\) and \\(f_{a, b}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\) differ by exactly 1 , while \\(f_{a, c}(X)=f_{a, c}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\) and \\(f_{b, c}(X)=f_{b, c}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\). This yields \\(\\left|f(X)-f\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=1\\), i.e., on any swap the value of \\(f\\) changes by 1 . Hence \\(d(X, Y) \\geqslant\\) \\(|f(X)-f(Y)|\\) for any two chameleons \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). In particular, \\(d(P, Q) \\geqslant|f(P)-f(Q)|=3 n^{2}\\), as desired.\n\nBack to the problem, take any chameleon \\(X\\) and notice that \\(d(X, P)+d(X, Q) \\geqslant d(P, Q) \\geqslant\\) \\(3 n^{2}\\) by the lemma. Consequently, \\(\\max \\{d(X, P), d(X, Q)\\} \\geqslant \\frac{3 n^{2}}{2}\\), which establishes the problem statement.\n\nComment 1. The problem may be reformulated in a graph language. Construct a graph \\(G\\) with the chameleons as vertices, two vertices being connected with an edge if and only if these chameleons differ by a single swap. Then \\(d(X, Y)\\) is the usual distance between the vertices \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in this graph. Recall that the radius of a connected graph \\(G\\) is defined as\n\n\\[\nr(G)=\\min _{v \\in V} \\max _{u \\in V} d(u, v)\n\\]\n\nSo we need to prove that the radius of the constructed graph is at least \\(3 n^{2} / 2\\).\nIt is well-known that the radius of any connected graph is at least the half of its diameter (which is simply \\(\\max _{u, v \\in V} d(u, v)\\) ). Exactly this fact has been used above in order to finish the solution.\n\nSolution 2. We use the notion of distance from Solution 1, but provide a different lower bound for it.\n\nIn any chameleon \\(X\\), we enumerate the positions in it from left to right by \\(1,2, \\ldots, 3 n\\). Define \\(s_{c}(X)\\) as the sum of positions occupied by \\(c\\). The value of \\(s_{c}\\) changes by at most 1 on each swap, but this fact alone does not suffice to solve the problem; so we need an improvement.\n\nFor every chameleon \\(X\\), denote by \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\) the sequence obtained from \\(X\\) by removing all \\(n\\) letters \\(c\\). Enumerate the positions in \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\) from left to right by \\(1,2, \\ldots, 2 n\\), and define \\(s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X)\\) as the sum of positions in \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\) occupied by \\(b\\). (In other words, here we consider the positions of the \\(b\\) 's relatively to the \\(a\\) 's only.) Finally, denote\n\n\\[\nd^{\\prime}(X, Y):=\\left|s_{c}(X)-s_{c}(Y)\\right|+\\left|s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X)-s_{\\bar{c}, b}(Y)\\right| .\n\\]\n\nNow consider any swap changing a chameleon \\(X\\) to \\(X^{\\prime}\\). If no letter \\(c\\) is involved into this swap, then \\(s_{c}(X)=s_{c}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\); on the other hand, exactly one letter \\(b\\) changes its position in \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\), so \\(\\left|s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X)-s_{\\bar{c}, b}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=1\\). If a letter \\(c\\) is involved into a swap, then \\(X_{\\bar{c}}=X_{\\bar{c}}^{\\prime}\\), so \\(s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X)=s_{\\bar{c}, b}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left|s_{c}(X)-s_{c}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=1\\). Thus, in all cases we have \\(d^{\\prime}\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)=1\\).\n\nAs in the previous solution, this means that \\(d(X, Y) \\geqslant d^{\\prime}(X, Y)\\) for any two chameleons \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Now, for any chameleon \\(X\\) we will indicate a chameleon \\(Y\\) with \\(d^{\\prime}(X, Y) \\geqslant 3 n^{2} / 2\\), thus finishing the solution.\n\nThe function \\(s_{c}\\) attains all integer values from \\(1+\\cdots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) to \\((2 n+1)+\\cdots+3 n=\\) \\(2 n^{2}+\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). If \\(s_{c}(X) \\leqslant n^{2}+\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), then we put the letter \\(c\\) into the last \\(n\\) positions in \\(Y\\); otherwise we put the letter \\(c\\) into the first \\(n\\) positions in \\(Y\\). In either case we already have \\(\\left|s_{c}(X)-s_{c}(Y)\\right| \\geqslant n^{2}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(s_{\\bar{c}, b}\\) ranges from \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) to \\(n^{2}+\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). So, if \\(s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X) \\leqslant \\frac{n^{2}}{2}+\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), then we put the letter \\(b\\) into the last \\(n\\) positions in \\(Y\\) which are still free; otherwise, we put the letter \\(b\\) into the first \\(n\\) such positions. The remaining positions are occupied by \\(a\\). In any case, we have \\(\\left|s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X)-s_{\\bar{c}, b}(Y)\\right| \\geqslant \\frac{n^{2}}{2}\\), thus \\(d^{\\prime}(X, Y) \\geqslant n^{2}+\\frac{n^{2}}{2}=\\frac{3 n^{2}}{2}\\), as desired.\n\nComment 2. The two solutions above used two lower bounds \\(|f(X)-f(Y)|\\) and \\(d^{\\prime}(X, Y)\\) for the number \\(d(X, Y)\\). One may see that these bounds are closely related to each other, as\n\n\\[\nf_{a, c}(X)+f_{b, c}(X)=s_{c}(X)-\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f_{a, b}(X)=s_{\\bar{c}, b}(X)-\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} .\n\\]\n\nOne can see that, e.g., the bound \\(d^{\\prime}(X, Y)\\) could as well be used in the proof of the lemma in Solution 1.\nLet us describe here an even sharper bound which also can be used in different versions of the solutions above.\n\nIn each chameleon \\(X\\), enumerate the occurrences of \\(a\\) from the left to the right as \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\). Since we got rid of swaps of identical letters, the relative order of these letters remains the same during the swaps. Perform the same operation with the other letters, obtaining new letters \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\) and \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\). Denote by \\(A\\) the set of the \\(3 n\\) obtained letters.\n\nSince all \\(3 n\\) letters became different, for any chameleon \\(X\\) and any \\(s \\in A\\) we may define the position \\(N_{s}(X)\\) of \\(s\\) in \\(X\\) (thus \\(1 \\leqslant N_{s}(X) \\leqslant 3 n\\) ). Now, for any two chameleons \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) we say that a pair of letters ( \\(s, t\\) ) \\(\\in A \\times A\\) is an ( \\(X, Y\\) )-inversion if \\(N_{s}(X)<N_{t}(X)\\) but \\(N_{s}(Y)>N_{t}(Y)\\), and define \\(d^{*}(X, Y)\\) to be the number of ( \\(X, Y\\) )-inversions. Then for any two chameleons \\(Y\\) and \\(Y^{\\prime}\\) differing by a single swap, we have \\(\\left|d^{*}(X, Y)-d^{*}\\left(X, Y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=1\\). Since \\(d^{*}(X, X)=0\\), this yields \\(d(X, Y) \\geqslant d^{*}(X, Y)\\) for any pair of chameleons \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The bound \\(d^{*}\\) may also be used in both Solution 1 and Solution 2.\n\nComment 3. In fact, one may prove that the distance \\(d^{*}\\) defined in the previous comment coincides with \\(d\\). Indeed, if \\(X \\neq Y\\), then there exist an ( \\(X, Y\\) )-inversion ( \\(s, t\\) ). One can show that such \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) may be chosen to occupy consecutive positions in \\(Y\\). Clearly, \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) correspond to different letters among \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\). So, swapping them in \\(Y\\) we get another chameleon \\(Y^{\\prime}\\) with \\(d^{*}\\left(X, Y^{\\prime}\\right)=d^{*}(X, Y)-1\\). Proceeding in this manner, we may change \\(Y\\) to \\(X\\) in \\(d^{*}(X, Y)\\) steps.\n\nUsing this fact, one can show that the estimate in the problem statement is sharp for all \\(n \\geqslant 2\\). (For \\(n=1\\) it is not sharp, since any permutation of three letters can be changed to an opposite one in no less than three swaps.) We outline the proof below.\n\nFor any \\(k \\geqslant 0\\), define\n\n\\[\nX_{2 k}=\\underbrace{a b c a b c \\ldots a b c}_{3 k \\text { letters }} \\underbrace{c b a c b a \\ldots c b a}_{3 k \\text { letters }} \\text { and } X_{2 k+3}=\\underbrace{a b c a b c \\ldots a b c}_{3 k \\text { letters }} a b c b c a c a b \\underbrace{c b a c b a \\ldots c b a}_{3 k \\text { letters }} .\n\\]\n\nWe claim that for every \\(n \\geqslant 2\\) and every chameleon \\(Y\\), we have \\(d^{*}\\left(X_{n}, Y\\right) \\leqslant\\left\\lceil 3 n^{2} / 2\\right\\rceil\\). This will mean that for every \\(n \\geqslant 2\\) the number \\(3 n^{2} / 2\\) in the problem statement cannot be changed by any number larger than \\(\\left\\lceil 3 n^{2} / 2\\right\\rceil\\).\n\nFor any distinct letters \\(u, v \\in\\{a, b, c\\}\\) and any two chameleons \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we define \\(d_{u, v}^{*}(X, Y)\\) as the number of ( \\(X, Y\\) )-inversions ( \\(s, t\\) ) such that \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) are instances of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) (in any of the two possible orders). Then \\(d^{*}(X, Y)=d_{a, b}^{*}(X, Y)+d_{b, c}^{*}(X, Y)+d_{c, a}^{*}(X, Y)\\).\n\nWe start with the case when \\(n=2 k\\) is even; denote \\(X=X_{2 k}\\). We show that \\(d_{a, b}^{*}(X, Y) \\leqslant 2 k^{2}\\) for any chameleon \\(Y\\); this yields the required estimate. Proceed by the induction on \\(k\\) with the trivial base case \\(k=0\\). To perform the induction step, notice that \\(d_{a, b}^{*}(X, Y)\\) is indeed the minimal number of swaps needed to change \\(Y_{\\bar{c}}\\) into \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\). One may show that moving \\(a_{1}\\) and \\(a_{2 k}\\) in \\(Y\\) onto the first and the last positions in \\(Y\\), respectively, takes at most \\(2 k\\) swaps, and that subsequent moving \\(b_{1}\\) and \\(b_{2 k}\\) onto the second and the second last positions takes at most \\(2 k-2\\) swaps. After performing that, one may delete these letters from both \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\) and \\(Y_{\\bar{c}}\\) and apply the induction hypothesis; so \\(X_{\\bar{c}}\\) can be obtained from \\(Y_{\\bar{c}}\\) using at most \\(2(k-1)^{2}+2 k+(2 k-2)=2 k^{2}\\) swaps, as required.\n\nIf \\(n=2 k+3\\) is odd, the proof is similar but more technically involved. Namely, we claim that \\(d_{a, b}^{*}\\left(X_{2 k+3}, Y\\right) \\leqslant 2 k^{2}+6 k+5\\) for any chameleon \\(Y\\), and that the equality is achieved only if \\(Y_{\\bar{c}}=\\) \\(b b \\ldots b a a \\ldots a\\). The proof proceeds by a similar induction, with some care taken of the base case, as well as of extracting the equality case. Similar estimates hold for \\(d_{b, c}^{*}\\) and \\(d_{c, a}^{*}\\). Summing three such estimates, we obtain\n\n\\[\nd^{*}\\left(X_{2 k+3}, Y\\right) \\leqslant 3\\left(2 k^{2}+6 k+5\\right)=\\left\\lceil\\frac{3 n^{2}}{2}\\right\\rceil+1\n\\]\n\nwhich is by 1 more than we need. But the equality could be achieved only if \\(Y_{\\bar{c}}=b b \\ldots b a a \\ldots a\\) and, similarly, \\(Y_{\\bar{b}}=a a \\ldots a c c \\ldots c\\) and \\(Y_{\\bar{a}}=c c \\ldots c b b \\ldots b\\). Since these three equalities cannot hold simultaneously, the proof is finished."}

Call an operation of type (1) an insertion, and an operation of type (2) a merge.\n\nOnly one move is possible when \\(k=1\\), so we have \\(m(n, 1)=1\\). From now on we consider \\(k \\geqslant 2\\), and we may assume Sir Alex's last move was a merge. Then, just before the last move, there were exactly two cells with the number \\(2^{n-1}\\), and the other \\(k-2\\) cells were empty.\n\nPaint one of those numbers \\(2^{n-1}\\) blue, and the other one red. Now trace back Sir Alex's moves, always painting the numbers blue or red following this rule: if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) merge into \\(c\\), paint \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with the same color as \\(c\\). Notice that in this backward process new numbers are produced only by reversing merges, since reversing an insertion simply means deleting one of the numbers. Therefore, all numbers appearing in the whole process will receive one of the two colors.\n\nSir Alex's first move is an insertion. Without loss of generality, assume this first number inserted is blue. Then, from this point on, until the last move, there is always at least one cell with a blue number.\n\nBesides the last move, there is no move involving a blue and a red number, since all merges involves numbers with the same color, and insertions involve only one number. Call an insertion of a blue number or merge of two blue numbers a blue move, and define a red move analogously.\n\nThe whole sequence of blue moves could be repeated on another row of \\(k\\) cells to produce one cell with the number \\(2^{n-1}\\) and all the others empty, so there are at most \\(m(n-1, k)\\) blue moves.\n\nNow we look at the red moves. Since every time we perform a red move there is at least one cell occupied with a blue number, the whole sequence of red moves could be repeated on a row of \\(k-1\\) cells to produce one cell with the number \\(2^{n-1}\\) and all the others empty, so there are at most \\(m(n-1, k-1)\\) red moves. This proves that\n\n\\[\nm(n, k) \\leqslant m(n-1, k)+m(n-1, k-1)+1\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, we can start with an empty row of \\(k\\) cells and perform \\(m(n-1, k)\\) moves to produce one cell with the number \\(2^{n-1}\\) and all the others empty, and after that perform \\(m(n-1, k-1)\\) moves on those \\(k-1\\) empty cells to produce the number \\(2^{n-1}\\) in one of them, leaving \\(k-2\\) empty. With one more merge we get one cell with \\(2^{n}\\) and the others empty, proving that\n\n\\[\nm(n, k) \\geqslant m(n-1, k)+m(n-1, k-1)+1\n\\]\n\nIt follows that\n\n\\[\nm(n, k)=m(n-1, k)+m(n-1, k-1)+1,\n\\]\n\nfor \\(n \\geqslant 1\\) and \\(k \\geqslant 2\\).\nIf \\(k=1\\) or \\(n=0\\), we must insert \\(2^{n}\\) on our first move and immediately get the final configuration, so \\(m(0, k)=1\\) and \\(m(n, 1)=1\\), for \\(n \\geqslant 0\\) and \\(k \\geqslant 1\\).

After deducing the recurrence relation (1), it may be convenient to homogenize the recurrence relation by defining \\(h(n, k)=m(n, k)+1\\). We get the new relation\n\n\\[\nh(n, k)=h(n-1, k)+h(n-1, k),\n\\]\n\nfor \\(n \\geqslant 1\\) and \\(k \\geqslant 2\\), with initial values \\(h(0, k)=h(n, 1)=2\\), for \\(n \\geqslant 0\\) and \\(k \\geqslant 1\\).\nThis may help one to guess the answer, and also with other approaches like the one we develop next.\n\nComment 2. We can use a generating function to find the answer without guessing. We work with the homogenized recurrence relation (3). Define \\(h(n, 0)=0\\) so that (3) is valid for \\(k=1\\) as well. Now we set up the generating function \\(f(x, y)=\\sum_{n, k \\geqslant 0} h(n, k) x^{n} y^{k}\\). Multiplying the recurrence relation (3) by \\(x^{n} y^{k}\\) and summing over \\(n, k \\geqslant 1\\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n, k \\geqslant 1} h(n, k) x^{n} y^{k}=x \\sum_{n, k \\geqslant 1} h(n-1, k) x^{n-1} y^{k}+x y \\sum_{n, k \\geqslant 1} h(n-1, k-1) x^{n-1} y^{k-1} .\n\\]\n\nCompleting the missing terms leads to the following equation on \\(f(x, y)\\) :\n\n\\[\nf(x, y)-\\sum_{n \\geqslant 0} h(n, 0) x^{n}-\\sum_{k \\geqslant 1} h(0, k) y^{k}=x f(x, y)-x \\sum_{n \\geqslant 0} h(n, 0) x^{n}+x y f(x, y) .\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the initial values, we obtain\n\n\\[\nf(x, y)=\\frac{2 y}{1-y} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-x(1+y)} .\n\\]\n\nDeveloping as a power series, we get\n\n\\[\nf(x, y)=2 \\sum_{j \\geqslant 1} y^{j} \\cdot \\sum_{n \\geqslant 0}(1+y)^{n} x^{n}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^{n}\\) in this power series is\n\n\\[\n2 \\sum_{j \\geqslant 1} y^{j} \\cdot(1+y)^{n}=2 \\sum_{j \\geqslant 1} y^{j} \\cdot \\sum_{i \\geqslant 0}\\binom{n}{i} y^{i}\n\\]\n\nand extracting the coefficient of \\(y^{k}\\) in this last expression we finally obtain the value for \\(h(n, k)\\),\n\n\\[\nh(n, k)=2 \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\\binom{n}{j}\n\\]\n\nThis proves that\n\n\\[\nm(n, k)=2 \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\\binom{n}{j}-1\n\\]\n\nThe generating function approach also works if applied to the non-homogeneous recurrence relation (1), but the computations are less straightforward.\n\nSolution 2. Define merges and insertions as in Solution 1. After each move made by Sir Alex we compute the number \\(N\\) of empty cells, and the sum \\(S\\) of all the numbers written in the cells. Insertions always increase \\(S\\) by some power of 2 , and increase \\(N\\) exactly by 1 . Merges do not change \\(S\\) and decrease \\(N\\) exactly by 1 . Since the initial value of \\(N\\) is 0 and its final value is 1 , the total number of insertions exceeds that of merges by exactly one. So, to maximize the number of moves, we need to maximize the number of insertions.\n\nWe will need the following lemma.\nLemma. If the binary representation of a positive integer \\(A\\) has \\(d\\) nonzero digits, then \\(A\\) cannot be represented as a sum of fewer than \\(d\\) powers of 2 . Moreover, any representation of \\(A\\) as a sum of \\(d\\) powers of 2 must coincide with its binary representation.\nProof. Let \\(s\\) be the minimum number of summands in all possible representations of \\(A\\) as sum of powers of 2 . Suppose there is such a representation with \\(s\\) summands, where two of the summands are equal to each other. Then, replacing those two summands with the result of their sum, we obtain a representation with fewer than \\(s\\) summands, which is a contradiction. We deduce that in any representation with \\(s\\) summands, the summands are all distinct, so any such representation must coincide with the unique binary representation of \\(A\\), and \\(s=d\\).\n\nNow we split the solution into a sequence of claims.\nClaim 1. After every move, the number \\(S\\) is the sum of at most \\(k-1\\) distinct powers of 2 .\nProof. If \\(S\\) is the sum of \\(k\\) (or more) distinct powers of 2 , the Lemma implies that the \\(k\\) cells are filled with these numbers. This is a contradiction since no more merges or insertions can be made.\n\nLet \\(A(n, k-1)\\) denote the set of all positive integers not exceeding \\(2^{n}\\) with at most \\(k-1\\) nonzero digits in its base 2 representation. Since every insertion increases the value of \\(S\\), by Claim 1, the total number of insertions is at most \\(|A(n, k-1)|\\). We proceed to prove that it is possible to achieve this number of insertions.\nClaim 2. Let \\(A(n, k-1)=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{m}\\right\\}\\), with \\(a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{m}\\). If after some of Sir Alex's moves the value of \\(S\\) is \\(a_{j}\\), with \\(j \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, m-1\\}\\), then there is a sequence of moves after which the value of \\(S\\) is exactly \\(a_{j+1}\\).\nProof. Suppose \\(S=a_{j}\\). Performing all possible merges, we eventually get different powers of 2 in all nonempty cells. After that, by Claim 1 there will be at least one empty cell, in which we want to insert \\(a_{j+1}-a_{j}\\). It remains to show that \\(a_{j+1}-a_{j}\\) is a power of 2 .\n\nFor this purpose, we notice that if \\(a_{j}\\) has less than \\(k-1\\) nonzero digits in base 2 then \\(a_{j+1}=a_{j}+1\\). Otherwise, we have \\(a_{j}=2^{b_{k-1}}+\\cdots+2^{b_{2}}+2^{b_{1}}\\) with \\(b_{1}<b_{2}<\\cdots<b_{k-1}\\). Then, adding any number less than \\(2^{b_{1}}\\) to \\(a_{j}\\) will result in a number with more than \\(k-1\\) nonzero\nbinary digits. On the other hand, \\(a_{j}+2^{b_{1}}\\) is a sum of \\(k\\) powers of 2 , not all distinct, so by the Lemma it will be a sum of less then \\(k\\) distinct powers of 2 .

We now need to convince ourselves that each pair ( \\(x_{k, k} ; x_{k+1, k}\\) ) remains spatially together in this new row. But \\(x_{k, k}\\) and \\(x_{k+1, k}\\) belong to the same column/block of consecutive \\(N+1\\) people; the only people that could possibly stand between them were also in this block, and they are all gone.\n\nSolution 2. Split the people into \\(N\\) groups by height: group \\(G_{1}\\) has the \\(N+1\\) tallest ones, group \\(G_{2}\\) has the next \\(N+1\\) tallest, and so on, up to group \\(G_{N}\\) with the \\(N+1\\) shortest people.\n\nNow scan the original row from left to right, stopping as soon as you have scanned two people (consecutively or not) from the same group, say, \\(G_{i}\\). Since we have \\(N\\) groups, this must happen before or at the \\((N+1)^{\\text {th }}\\) person of the row. Choose this pair of people, removing all the other people from the same group \\(G_{i}\\) and also all people that have been scanned so far. The only people that could separate this pair's heights were in group \\(G_{i}\\) (and they are gone); the only people that could separate this pair's positions were already scanned (and they are gone too).\n\nWe are now left with \\(N-1\\) groups (all except \\(G_{i}\\) ). Since each of them lost at most one person, each one has at least \\(N\\) unscanned people left in the row. Repeat the scanning process from left to right, choosing the next two people from the same group, removing this group and\neveryone scanned up to that point. Once again we end up with two people who are next to each other in the remaining row and whose heights cannot be separated by anyone else who remains (since the rest of their group is gone). After picking these 2 pairs, we still have \\(N-2\\) groups with at least \\(N-1\\) people each.\n\nIf we repeat the scanning process a total of \\(N\\) times, it is easy to check that we will end up with 2 people from each group, for a total of \\(2 N\\) people remaining. The height order is guaranteed by the grouping, and the scanning construction from left to right guarantees that each pair from a group stand next to each other in the final row. We are done.\n\nSolution 3. This is essentially the same as solution 1, but presented inductively. The essence of the argument is the following lemma.\nLemma. Assume that we have \\(N\\) disjoint groups of at least \\(N+1\\) people in each, all people have distinct heights. Then one can choose two people from each group so that among the chosen people, the two tallest ones are in one group, the third and the fourth tallest ones are in one group, ..., and the two shortest ones are in one group.\nProof. Induction on \\(N \\geqslant 1\\); for \\(N=1\\), the statement is trivial.\nConsider now \\(N\\) groups \\(G_{1}, \\ldots, G_{N}\\) with at least \\(N+1\\) people in each for \\(N \\geqslant 2\\). Enumerate the people by \\(1,2, \\ldots, N(N+1)\\) according to their height, say, from tallest to shortest. Find the least \\(s\\) such that two people among \\(1,2, \\ldots, s\\) are in one group (without loss of generality, say this group is \\(G_{N}\\) ). By the minimality of \\(s\\), the two mentioned people in \\(G_{N}\\) are \\(s\\) and some \\(i<s\\).\n\nNow we choose people \\(i\\) and \\(s\\) in \\(G_{N}\\), forget about this group, and remove the people \\(1,2, \\ldots, s\\) from \\(G_{1}, \\ldots, G_{N-1}\\). Due to minimality of \\(s\\) again, each of the obtained groups \\(G_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, G_{N-1}^{\\prime}\\) contains at least \\(N\\) people. By the induction hypothesis, one can choose a pair of people from each of \\(G_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, G_{N-1}^{\\prime}\\) so as to satisfy the required conditions. Since all these people have numbers greater than \\(s\\), addition of the pair \\((s, i)\\) from \\(G_{N}\\) does not violate these requirements.\n\nTo solve the problem, it suffices now to split the row into \\(N\\) contiguous groups with \\(N+1\\) people in each and apply the Lemma to those groups.\n\nComment 1. One can identify each person with a pair of indices \\((p, h)(p, h \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, N(N+1)\\})\\) so that the \\(p^{\\text {th }}\\) person in the row (say, from left to right) is the \\(h^{\\text {th }}\\) tallest person in the group. Say that ( \\(a, b\\) ) separates ( \\(x_{1}, y_{1}\\) ) and ( \\(x_{2}, y_{2}\\) ) whenever \\(a\\) is strictly between \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(y_{1}\\), or \\(b\\) is strictly between \\(x_{2}\\) and \\(y_{2}\\). So the coach wants to pick \\(2 N\\) people \\(\\left(p_{i}, h_{i}\\right)(i=1,2, \\ldots, 2 N)\\) such that no chosen person separates ( \\(p_{1}, h_{1}\\) ) from ( \\(p_{2}, h_{2}\\) ), no chosen person separates ( \\(p_{3}, h_{3}\\) ) and ( \\(p_{4}, h_{4}\\) ), and so on. This formulation reveals a duality between positions and heights. In that sense, solutions 1 and 2 are dual of each other.\n\nComment 2. The number \\(N(N+1)\\) is sharp for \\(N=2\\) and \\(N=3\\), due to arrangements \\(1,5,3,4,2\\) and \\(1,10,6,4,3,9,5,8,7,2,11\\)."}

We distinguish two cases.\nCase 1: \\(X \\cap M_{1} \\neq \\varnothing\\).\nA cube from \\(X \\cap M_{1}\\) should appear in all three boxes \\(X, Y\\), and \\(Z\\), so it should lie in \\(X \\cap Y \\cap Z\\). Thus \\(X \\cap M_{1}=X \\cap Y \\cap Z\\) and \\(\\left|X \\cap M_{1}\\right|=1\\).\n\nConsider now the cubes in \\(X \\cap M_{2}\\). There are at most 2(n-1) of them lying in \\(X \\cap Y\\) or \\(X \\cap Z\\) (because the cube from \\(X \\cap Y \\cap Z\\) is in \\(M_{1}\\) ). Let \\(a\\) be some other cube from \\(X \\cap M_{2}\\). Recall that there is just one other cube \\(a^{\\prime}\\) sharing a color with \\(a\\). But both \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) should contain such cube, so \\(a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z\\) (but \\(a^{\\prime} \\notin X \\cap Y \\cap Z\\) ). The map \\(a \\mapsto a^{\\prime}\\) is clearly injective, so the number of cubes \\(a\\) we are interested in does not exceed \\(|(Y \\cap Z) \\backslash X|=n-1\\). Thus \\(\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant 2(n-1)+(n-1)=3(n-1)\\), and hence \\(4\\left|X \\cap M_{1}\\right|+\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant 4+3(n-1)=3 n+1\\).\nCase 2: \\(X \\cap M_{1}=\\varnothing\\).\nIn this case, the same argument applies with several changes. Indeed, \\(X \\cap M_{2}\\) contains at most \\(2 n-1\\) cubes from \\(X \\cap Y\\) or \\(X \\cap Z\\). Any other cube \\(a\\) in \\(X \\cap M_{2}\\) corresponds to some \\(a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z\\) (possibly with \\(a^{\\prime} \\in X\\) ), so there are at most \\(n\\) of them. All this results in \\(\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant(2 n-1)+n=3 n-1\\), which is even better than we need (by the assumptions of our case).\n\nSumming up the inequalities from the Claim over all \\(x\\)-boxes \\(X\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\n4 n_{1}+n_{2} \\leqslant n(3 n+1)\n\\]\n\nObviously, we also have \\(n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=n^{3}\\).\nNow we are prepared to estimate \\(C\\). Due to the definition of the \\(M_{i}\\), we have \\(n_{i} \\geqslant i\\left|\\mathcal{C}_{i}\\right|\\), so\n\n\\[\nC \\leqslant n_{1}+\\frac{n_{2}}{2}+\\frac{n_{3}}{3}=\\frac{n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}}{3}+\\frac{4 n_{1}+n_{2}}{6} \\leqslant \\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\\frac{3 n^{2}+n}{6}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}\n\\]\n\nIt remains to present an example of an appropriate coloring in the above-mentioned number of colors. For each color, we present the set of all cubes of this color. These sets are:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\(n\\) singletons of the form \\(S_{i}=\\{(i, i, i)\\}\\) (with \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\) );\n  \\item 3( \\(\\begin{aligned} & n \\\\ & 2\\) ) doubletons of the forms \\(D_{i, j}^{1}=\\{(i, j, j),(j, i, i)\\}, D_{i, j}^{2}=\\{(j, i, j),(i, j, i)\\}\\), and \\(D_{i, j}^{3}=\\) \\(\\{(j, j, i),(i, i, j)\\}\\) (with \\(1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n\\) );\n  \\item \\(2\\binom{n}{3}\\) triplets of the form \\(T_{i, j, k}=\\{(i, j, k),(j, k, i),(k, i, j)\\}\\) (with \\(1 \\leqslant i<j<k \\leqslant n\\) or \\(1 \\leqslant i<k<j \\leqslant n\\) ).\n\n\nOne may easily see that the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) boxes of each orientation contain the same set of colors, and that\n\n\\[\nn+\\frac{3 n(n-1)}{2}+\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}\n\\]\n\ncolors are used, as required.\nSolution 2. We will approach a new version of the original problem. In this new version, each cube may have a color, or be invisible (not both). Now we make sets of colors for each \\(n \\times n \\times 1\\) box as before (where \"invisible\" is not considered a color) and group them by orientation, also as before. Finally, we require that, for every non-empty set in any group, the same set must appear in the other 2 groups. What is the maximum number of colors present with these new requirements?\n\nLet us call strange a big \\(n \\times n \\times n\\) cube whose painting scheme satisfies the new requirements, and let \\(D\\) be the number of colors in a strange cube. Note that any cube that satisfies the original requirements is also strange, so \\(\\max (D)\\) is an upper bound for the original answer.\nClaim. \\(D \\leqslant \\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}\\).\nProof. The proof is by induction on \\(n\\). If \\(n=1\\), we must paint the cube with at most 1 color.\nNow, pick a \\(n \\times n \\times n\\) strange cube \\(A\\), where \\(n \\geqslant 2\\). If \\(A\\) is completely invisible, \\(D=0\\) and we are done. Otherwise, pick a non-empty set of colors \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) which corresponds to, say, the boxes \\(X, Y\\) and \\(Z\\) of different orientations.\n\nNow find all cubes in \\(A\\) whose colors are in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and make them invisible. Since \\(X, Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are now completely invisible, we can throw them away and focus on the remaining \\((n-1) \\times(n-1) \\times(n-1)\\) cube \\(B\\). The sets of colors in all the groups for \\(B\\) are the same as the sets for \\(A\\), removing exactly the colors in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), and no others! Therefore, every nonempty set that appears in one group for \\(B\\) still shows up in all possible orientations (it is possible that an empty set of colors in \\(B\\) only matched \\(X, Y\\) or \\(Z\\) before these were thrown away, but remember we do not require empty sets to match anyway). In summary, \\(B\\) is also strange.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we may assume that \\(B\\) has at most \\(\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}\\) colors. Since there were at most \\(n^{2}\\) different colors in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), we have that \\(A\\) has at most \\(\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}+n^{2}=\\) \\(\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}\\) colors.\n\nFinally, the construction in the previous solution shows a painting scheme (with no invisible cubes) that reaches this maximum, so we are done."}

We have\n\\(f_{X * Y}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash(X * Y)=\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash X\\right) \\backslash f_{X}(Y)=f_{X}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right) \\backslash f_{X}(Y)=f_{X}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash Y\\right)=f_{X}\\left(f_{Y}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)\\right)\\).\nThus, the functions \\(f_{X * Y}\\) and \\(f_{X} \\circ f_{Y}\\) are strictly increasing functions with the same range. Because a strictly function is uniquely defined by its range, we have \\(f_{X * Y}=f_{X} \\circ f_{Y}\\).\n\nLemma 1 implies that * is associative, in the sense that \\((A * B) * C=A *(B * C)\\) for any finite sets \\(A, B\\), and \\(C\\) of positive integers. We prove the associativity by noting\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash((A * B) * C)=f_{(A * B) * C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=f_{A * B}\\left(f_{C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)\\right)=f_{A}\\left(f_{B}\\left(f_{C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)\\right)\\right) \n=f_{A}\\left(f_{B * C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=f_{A *(B * C)}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash(A *(B * C))\\right.\n\n\\]\n\nIn light of the associativity of *, we may drop the parentheses when we write expressions like \\(A *(B * C)\\). We also introduce the notation\n\n\\[\nX^{* k}=\\underbrace{X *(X * \\cdots *(X *(X * X)) \\ldots)}_{X \\text { appears } k \\text { times }}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is then to show that \\(A * B=B * A\\) implies \\(A^{* b}=B^{* a}\\). We will do so via the following general lemma.\nLemma 2. Suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are finite sets of positive integers satisfying \\(X * Y=Y * X\\) and \\(|X|=|Y|\\). Then, we must have \\(X=Y\\).\nProof. Assume that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not equal. Let \\(s\\) be the largest number in exactly one of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Without loss of generality, say that \\(s \\in X \\backslash Y\\). The number \\(f_{X}(s)\\) counts the \\(s^{\\text {th }}\\) number not in \\(X\\), which implies that\n\n\\[\nf_{X}(s)=s+\\left|X \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|\n\\]\n\nSince \\(f_{X}(s) \\geqslant s\\), we have that\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cap X=\\left\\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cap Y\n\\]\n\nwhich, together with the assumption that \\(|X|=|Y|\\), gives\n\n\\[\n\\left|X \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|=\\left|Y \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right| .\n\\]\n\nNow consider the equation\n\n\\[\nt-|Y \\cap\\{1,2, \\ldots, t\\}|=s .\n\\]\n\nThis equation is satisfied only when \\(t \\in\\left[f_{Y}(s), f_{Y}(s+1)\\right)\\), because the left hand side counts the number of elements up to \\(t\\) that are not in \\(Y\\). We have that the value \\(t=f_{X}(s)\\) satisfies the above equation because of (1) and (2). Furthermore, since \\(f_{X}(s) \\notin X\\) and \\(f_{X}(s) \\geqslant s\\), we have that \\(f_{X}(s) \\notin Y\\) due to the maximality of \\(s\\). Thus, by the above discussion, we must have \\(f_{X}(s)=f_{Y}(s)\\).\n\nFinally, we arrive at a contradiction. The value \\(f_{X}(s)\\) is neither in \\(X\\) nor in \\(f_{X}(Y)\\), because \\(s\\) is not in \\(Y\\) by assumption. Thus, \\(f_{X}(s) \\notin X * Y\\). However, since \\(s \\in X\\), we have \\(f_{Y}(s) \\in Y * X\\), a contradiction.\n\nWe are now ready to finish the proof. Note first of all that \\(\\left|A^{* b}\\right|=a b=\\left|B^{* a}\\right|\\). Moreover, since \\(A * B=B * A\\), and \\(*\\) is associative, it follows that \\(A^{* b} * B^{* a}=B^{* a} * A^{* b}\\). Thus, by Lemma 2, we have \\(A^{* b}=B^{* a}\\), as desired.\n\nComment 1. Taking \\(A=X^{* k}\\) and \\(B=X^{* l}\\) generates many non-trivial examples where \\(A * B=B * A\\). There are also other examples not of this form. For example, if \\(A=\\{1,2,4\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1,3\\}\\), then \\(A * B=\\{1,2,3,4,6\\}=B * A\\).\nSolution 2. We will use Lemma 1 from Solution 1. Additionally, let \\(X^{* k}\\) be defined as in Solution 1. If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are finite sets, then\n\n\\[\nf_{X}=f_{Y} \\Longleftrightarrow f_{X}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=f_{Y}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash X\\right)=\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash Y\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow X=Y,\n\\]\n\nwhere the first equivalence is because \\(f_{X}\\) and \\(f_{Y}\\) are strictly increasing functions, and the second equivalence is because \\(f_{X}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash X\\) and \\(f_{Y}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash Y\\).\n\nDenote \\(g=f_{A}\\) and \\(h=f_{B}\\). The given relation \\(A * B=B * A\\) is equivalent to \\(f_{A * B}=f_{B * A}\\) because of (3), and by Lemma 1 of the first solution, this is equivalent to \\(g \\circ h=h \\circ g\\). Similarly, the required relation \\(A^{* b}=B^{* a}\\) is equivalent to \\(g^{b}=h^{a}\\). We will show that\n\n\\[\ng^{b}(n)=h^{a}(n)\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), which suffices to solve the problem.\nTo start, we claim that (4) holds for all sufficiently large \\(n\\). Indeed, let \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be the maximal elements of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively; we may assume that \\(p \\geqslant q\\). Then, for every \\(n \\geqslant p\\) we have \\(g(n)=n+a\\) and \\(h(n)=n+b\\), whence \\(g^{b}(n)=n+a b=h^{a}(n)\\), as was claimed.\n\nIn view of this claim, if (4) is not identically true, then there exists a maximal \\(s\\) with \\(g^{b}(s) \\neq\\) \\(h^{a}(s)\\). Without loss of generality, we may assume that \\(g(s) \\neq s\\), for if we had \\(g(s)=h(s)=s\\), then \\(s\\) would satisfy (4). As \\(g\\) is increasing, we then have \\(g(s)>s\\), so (4) holds for \\(n=g(s)\\). But then we have\n\n\\[\ng\\left(g^{b}(s)\\right)=g^{b+1}(s)=g^{b}(n)=h^{a}(n)=h^{a}(g(s))=g\\left(h^{a}(s)\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere the last equality holds in view of \\(g \\circ h=h \\circ g\\). By the injectivity of \\(g\\), the above equality yields \\(g^{b}(s)=h^{a}(s)\\), which contradicts the choice of \\(s\\). Thus, we have proved that (4) is identically true on \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), as desired.\n\nComment 2. We present another proof of Lemma 2 of the first solution.\nLet \\(x=|X|=|Y|\\). Say that \\(u\\) is the smallest number in \\(X\\) and \\(v\\) is the smallest number in \\(Y\\); assume without loss of generality that \\(u \\leqslant v\\).\n\nLet \\(T\\) be any finite set of positive integers, and define \\(t=|T|\\). Enumerate the elements of \\(X\\) as \\(x_{1}<x_{2}<\\cdots<x_{n}\\). Define \\(S_{m}=f_{\\left(T * X^{*(m-1)}\\right)}(X)\\), and enumerate its elements \\(s_{m, 1}<s_{m, 2}<\\cdots<\\) \\(s_{m, n}\\). Note that the \\(S_{m}\\) are pairwise disjoint; indeed, if we have \\(m<m^{\\prime}\\), then\n\n\\[\nS_{m} \\subset T * X^{* m} \\subset T * X^{*\\left(m^{\\prime}-1\\right)} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad S_{m^{\\prime}}=\\left(T * X^{* m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\backslash\\left(T * X^{*\\left(m^{\\prime}-1\\right)}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe claim the following statement, which essentially says that the \\(S_{m}\\) are eventually linear translates of each other:\n\nClaim. For every \\(i\\), there exists some \\(m_{i}\\) and \\(c_{i}\\) such that for all \\(m>m_{i}\\), we have that \\(s_{m, i}=t+m n-c_{i}\\). Furthermore, the \\(c_{i}\\) do not depend on the choice of \\(T\\).\n\nFirst, we show that this claim implies Lemma 2. We may choose \\(T=X\\) and \\(T=Y\\). Then, there is some \\(m^{\\prime}\\) such that for all \\(m \\geqslant m^{\\prime}\\), we have\n\n\\[\nf_{X^{* m}}(X)=f_{\\left(Y * X^{*(m-1)}\\right)}(X)\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(u\\) is the minimum element of \\(X, v\\) is the minimum element of \\(Y\\), and \\(u \\leqslant v\\), we have that\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\bigcup_{m=m^{\\prime}}^{\\infty} f_{X * m}(X)\\right) \\cup X^{* m^{\\prime}}=\\left(\\bigcup_{m=m^{\\prime}}^{\\infty} f_{\\left(Y * X^{*(m-1)}\\right)}(X)\\right) \\cup\\left(Y * X^{*\\left(m^{\\prime}-1\\right)}\\right)=\\{u, u+1, \\ldots\\}\n\\]\n\nand in both the first and second expressions, the unions are of pairwise distinct sets. By (5), we obtain \\(X^{* m^{\\prime}}=Y * X^{*\\left(m^{\\prime}-1\\right)}\\). Now, because \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) commute, we get \\(X^{* m^{\\prime}}=X^{*\\left(m^{\\prime}-1\\right)} * Y\\), and so \\(X=Y\\).\n\nWe now prove the claim.\nProof of the claim. We induct downwards on \\(i\\), first proving the statement for \\(i=n\\), and so on.\nAssume that \\(m\\) is chosen so that all elements of \\(S_{m}\\) are greater than all elements of \\(T\\) (which is possible because \\(T\\) is finite). For \\(i=n\\), we have that \\(s_{m, n}>s_{k, n}\\) for every \\(k<m\\). Thus, all \\((m-1) n\\) numbers of the form \\(s_{k, u}\\) for \\(k<m\\) and \\(1 \\leqslant u \\leqslant n\\) are less than \\(s_{m, n}\\). We then have that \\(s_{m, n}\\) is the \\(\\left((m-1) n+x_{n}\\right)^{\\text {th }}\\) number not in \\(T\\), which is equal to \\(t+(m-1) n+x_{n}\\). So we may choose \\(c_{n}=x_{n}-n\\), which does not depend on \\(T\\), which proves the base case for the induction.\n\nFor \\(i<n\\), we have again that all elements \\(s_{m, j}\\) for \\(j<i\\) and \\(s_{p, i}\\) for \\(p<m\\) are less than \\(s_{m, i}\\), so \\(s_{m, i}\\) is the \\(\\left((m-1) i+x_{i}\\right)^{\\text {th }}\\) element not in \\(T\\) or of the form \\(s_{p, j}\\) for \\(j>i\\) and \\(p<m\\). But by the inductive hypothesis, each of the sequences \\(s_{p, j}\\) is eventually periodic with period \\(n\\), and thus the sequence \\(s_{m, i}\\) such must be as well. Since each of the sequences \\(s_{p, j}-t\\) with \\(j>i\\) eventually do not depend on \\(T\\), the sequence \\(s_{m, i}-t\\) eventually does not depend on \\(T\\) either, so the inductive step is complete. This proves the claim and thus Lemma 2."}

This process goes on for as long as there are any lonely butterflies. Assuming that the process eventually stops, determine the number of comfortable butterflies at the final state.\n(Bulgaria)\nAnswer: \\(n^{2}+1\\).", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2017, "solution": "We always identify a butterfly with the lattice point it is situated at. For two points \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), we write \\(p \\geqslant q\\) if each coordinate of \\(p\\) is at least the corresponding coordinate of \\(q\\).

Let \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{H}}=\\{(x, 0): x \\geqslant 0\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{V}}=\\{(0, y): y \\geqslant 0\\}\\) be the sets of the lattice points lying on the horizontal and vertical boundary rays of \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\). Denote by \\(N(a)\\) the neighborhood of a lattice point \\(a\\).\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Initial observations. We call a set of lattice points up-right closed if its points stay in the set after being shifted by any lattice vector \\((i, j)\\) with \\(i, j \\geqslant 0\\). Whenever the butterflies form a up-right closed set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), we have \\(|N(p) \\cap \\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant|N(q) \\cap \\mathcal{S}|\\) for any two points \\(p, q \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) with \\(p \\geqslant q\\). So, since \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) is up-right closed, the set of butterflies at any moment also preserves this property. We assume all forthcoming sets of lattice points to be up-right closed.\n\n\nWhen speaking of some set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of lattice points, we call its points lonely, comfortable, or crowded with respect to this set (i.e., as if the butterflies were exactly at all points of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) ). We call a set \\(\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}\\) stable if it contains no lonely points. In what follows, we are interested only in those stable sets whose complements in \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) are finite, because one can easily see that only a finite number of butterflies can fly away on each minute.\n\nIf the initial set \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) of butterflies contains some stable set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), then, clearly no butterfly of this set will fly away. On the other hand, the set \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of all butterflies in the end of the process is stable. This means that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the largest (with respect to inclusion) stable set within \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\), and we are about to describe this set.\n2. A description of a final set. The following notion will be useful. Let \\(\\mathcal{U}=\\left\\{\\vec{u}_{1}, \\vec{u}_{2}, \\ldots, \\vec{u}_{d}\\right\\}\\) be a set of \\(d\\) pairwise non-parallel lattice vectors, each having a positive \\(x\\) - and a negative \\(y\\)-coordinate. Assume that they are numbered in increasing order according to slope. We now define a \\(\\mathcal{U}\\)-curve to be the broken line \\(p_{0} p_{1} \\ldots p_{d}\\) such that \\(p_{0} \\in \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{V}}, p_{d} \\in \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{H}}\\), and \\(\\overrightarrow{p_{i-1} p_{i}}=\\vec{u}_{i}\\) for all \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, m\\) (see the Figure below to the left).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_c0af87966e053f440e8cg-53}\n\nNow, let \\(\\mathcal{K}_{n}=\\{(i, j): 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n,-n \\leqslant j \\leqslant-1\\}\\). Consider all the rays emerging at \\(O\\) and passing through a point from \\(\\mathcal{K}_{n}\\); number them as \\(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\) in increasing order according to slope. Let \\(A_{i}\\) be the farthest from \\(O\\) lattice point in \\(r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}\\), set \\(k_{i}=\\left|r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}\\right|\\), let \\(\\vec{v}_{i}=\\overrightarrow{O A_{i}}\\), and finally denote \\(\\mathcal{V}=\\left\\{\\vec{v}_{i}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant m\\right\\}\\); see the Figure above to the right. We will concentrate on the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve \\(d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}\\); let \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) be the set of all lattice points \\(p\\) such that \\(p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}\\) for some (not necessarily lattice) point \\(p^{\\prime}\\) on the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve. In fact, we will show that \\(\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\nClearly, the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve is symmetric in the line \\(y=x\\). Denote by \\(D\\) the convex hull of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n3. We prove that the set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) contains all stable sets. Let \\(\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}\\) be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) ). Denote by \\(S\\) its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of \\(S\\) are lattice points. The boundary of \\(S\\) consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some \\(\\mathcal{V}_{*}\\)-curve for some set of lattice vectors \\(\\mathcal{V}_{*}\\).\nClaim 1. For every \\(\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}\\), there is a \\(\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}\\) co-directed with \\(\\vec{v}\\) with \\(\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|\\).\nProof. Let \\(\\ell\\) be the supporting line of \\(S\\) parallel to \\(\\vec{v}_{i}\\) (i.e., \\(\\ell\\) contains some point of \\(S\\), and the set \\(S\\) lies on one side of \\(\\ell\\) ). Take any point \\(b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}\\) and consider \\(N(b)\\). The line \\(\\ell\\) splits the set \\(N(b) \\backslash \\ell\\) into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Hence, in order for \\(b\\) not to be lonely, at least half of the set \\(\\ell \\cap N(b)\\) (which contains \\(2 k_{i}\\) points) should lie in \\(S\\). Thus, the boundary of \\(S\\) contains a segment \\(\\ell \\cap S\\) with at least \\(k_{i}+1\\) lattice points (including \\(b\\) ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector \\(\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_c0af87966e053f440e8cg-54}\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set \\(\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}\\) lies in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the \\(\\mathcal{V}_{*}\\)-curve lies in \\(D\\), i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let \\(p^{\\prime}\\) be an arbitrary vertex of the \\(\\mathcal{V}_{*}\\)-curve; \\(p^{\\prime}\\) partitions this curve into two parts, \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) (being down-right of \\(p\\) ) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) (being up-left of \\(p\\) ). The set \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is split now into two parts: \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}\\) consisting of those \\(\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}\\) for which \\(\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\) corresponds to a segment in \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), and a similar part \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\). Notice that the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve consists of several segments corresponding to \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}\\), followed by those corresponding to \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\). Hence there is a vertex \\(p\\) of the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve separating \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}\\) from \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\). Claim 1 now yields that \\(p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p\\), so \\(p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}\\), as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is contained in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n4. \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of \\(r_{i}\\); let \\(r_{i}^{\\prime}\\) be the ray complementary to \\(r_{i}\\). By our definitions, the set \\(N(O)\\) contains no points between the rays \\(r_{i}\\) and \\(r_{i+1}\\), as well as between \\(r_{i}^{\\prime}\\) and \\(r_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\).\nClaim 3. In the set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), all lattice points of the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve are comfortable.\nProof. Let \\(p\\) be any lattice point of the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve, belonging to some segment \\(d_{i} d_{i+1}\\). Draw the line \\(\\ell\\) containing this segment. Then \\(\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}\\) contains exactly \\(k_{i}+1\\) lattice points, all of which lie in \\(N(p)\\) except for \\(p\\). Thus, exactly half of the points in \\(N(p) \\cap \\ell\\) lie in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). It remains to show that all points of \\(N(p)\\) above \\(\\ell\\) lie in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) (recall that all the points below \\(\\ell\\) lack this property).\n\nNotice that each vector in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) has one coordinate greater than \\(n / 2\\); thus the neighborhood of \\(p\\) contains parts of at most two segments of the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve succeeding \\(d_{i} d_{i+1}\\), as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by \\(r_{j}\\) and \\(r_{j-1}^{\\prime}\\) (with \\(i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2\\) ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in \\(N(p)\\) above \\(\\ell\\) which could lie outside \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) lie in shifted angles between \\(r_{j}, r_{j+1}\\) or \\(r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}\\). But those angles, restricted to \\(N(p)\\), have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_c0af87966e053f440e8cg-55(1)}\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) which are not on the boundary of \\(D\\) are crowded.\nProof. Let \\(p \\in \\mathcal{D}\\) be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point \\(p^{\\prime}\\) on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of \\(N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}\\) by \\(\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}\\) is still in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), and \\(N(p)\\) contains at least one more point of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) - either below or to the left of \\(p\\). So, we may assume that \\(p\\) lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse \\(d_{i} d_{i+1}\\). Notice here that \\(d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)\\).\n\nDraw a line \\(\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}\\) through \\(p\\), and draw a vertical line \\(h\\) through \\(d_{i}\\); see Figure below. Let \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\) be the parts of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) lying to the left and to the right of \\(h\\), respectively (points of \\(\\mathcal{D} \\cap h\\) lie in both parts).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_c0af87966e053f440e8cg-55}\n\nProof of Claim 4\nNotice that the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}\\), and \\(\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}\\) are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) shifted by \\(\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}\\) still lies in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), as well as \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\) shifted by \\(\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}\\). As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of \\(N(p)\\) above \\(\\ell\\), along with those on \\(\\ell\\) to the left of \\(p\\). Since \\(N(p)\\) contains also \\(d_{i}\\) and \\(d_{i+1}\\), the point \\(p\\) is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that \\(\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}\\), and have shown that the lattice points on the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve are exactly the comfortable points of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of \\(\\mathcal{K}_{n}\\) (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment \\(d_{i} d_{i+1}\\) contains \\(k_{i}\\) lattice points different from \\(d_{i}\\). Taken over all \\(i\\), these points exhaust all the lattice points in the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve, except for \\(d_{1}\\), and thus the number of lattice points on the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve is \\(1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}\\). On the other hand, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}\\) is just the number of points in \\(\\mathcal{K}_{n}\\), so it equals \\(n^{2}\\). Hence the answer to the problem is \\(n^{2}+1\\).\n\nComment 1. The assumption that the process eventually stops is unnecessary for the problem, as one can see that, in fact, the process stops for every \\(n \\geqslant 1\\). Indeed, the proof of Claims 3 and 4 do not rely essentially on this assumption, and they together yield that the set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is stable. So, only butterflies that are not in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) may fly away, and this takes only a finite time.\n\nThis assumption has been inserted into the problem statement in order to avoid several technical details regarding finiteness issues. It may also simplify several other arguments.\n\nComment 2. The description of the final set \\(\\mathcal{F}(=\\mathcal{D})\\) seems to be crucial for the solution; the Problem Selection Committee is not aware of any solution that completely avoids such a description.\n\nOn the other hand, after the set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) has been defined, the further steps may be performed in several ways. For example, in order to prove that all butterflies outside \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) will fly away, one may argue as follows. (Here we will also make use of the assumption that the process eventually stops.)\n\nFirst of all, notice that the process can be modified in the following manner: Each minute, exactly one of the lonely butterflies flies away, until there are no more lonely butterflies. The modified process necessarily stops at the same state as the initial one. Indeed, one may observe, as in solution above, that the (unique) largest stable set is still the final set for the modified process.\n\nThus, in order to prove our claim, it suffices to indicate an order in which the butterflies should fly away in the new process; if we are able to exhaust the whole set \\(\\mathcal{Q} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}\\), we are done.\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{C}_{0}=d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}\\) be the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)-curve. Take its copy \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) and shift it downwards so that \\(d_{0}\\) comes to some point below the origin \\(O\\). Now we start moving \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) upwards continuously, until it comes back to its initial position \\(\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\). At each moment when \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) meets some lattice points, we convince all the butterflies at those points to fly away in a certain order. We will now show that we always have enough arguments for butterflies to do so, which will finish our argument for the claim..\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}=d_{0}^{\\prime} d_{1}^{\\prime} \\ldots d_{m}^{\\prime}\\) be a position of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) when it meets some butterflies. We assume that all butterflies under this current position of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) were already convinced enough and flied away. Consider the lowest butterfly \\(b\\) on \\(\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\). Let \\(d_{i}^{\\prime} d_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\) be the segment it lies on; we choose \\(i\\) so that \\(b \\neq d_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\) (this is possible because \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) as not yet reached \\(\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\) ).\n\nDraw a line \\(\\ell\\) containing the segment \\(d_{i}^{\\prime} d_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\). Then all the butterflies in \\(N(b)\\) are situated on or above \\(\\ell\\); moreover, those on \\(\\ell\\) all lie on the segment \\(d_{i} d_{i+1}\\). But this segment now contains at most \\(k_{i}\\) butterflies (including \\(b\\) ), since otherwise some butterfly had to occupy \\(d_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\) which is impossible by the choice of \\(b\\). Thus, \\(b\\) is lonely and hence may be convinced to fly away.\n\nAfter \\(b\\) has flied away, we switch to the lowest of the remaining butterflies on \\(\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\), and so on.\nClaims 3 and 4 also allow some different proofs which are not presented here.\n\nThis page is intentionally left blank"}

Let \\(\\overrightarrow{O_{B} C}\\) be the vector co-directional to \\(\\overrightarrow{O_{A} A}\\), with \\(C\\) lying on the perimeter of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). The rotations of \\(C\\) around \\(O_{B}\\) by multiples of \\(2 \\pi / n\\) form the required polygon. Indeed, it is regular, inscribed into \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) (due to the rotational symmetry of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) ), and finally the translation/homothety mapping \\(\\overrightarrow{O_{A} A}\\) to \\(\\overrightarrow{O_{B} C}\\) maps \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) to \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\nNow we separate two cases.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_c0af87966e053f440e8cg-66}\n\nCase 1: \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is a translation of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) by a vector \\(\\vec{v}\\).\nDenote by \\(t\\) the translation transform by vector \\(\\vec{v}\\). We need to prove that the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) which stay in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) under \\(t\\) are consecutive. To visualize the argument, we refer the plane to Cartesian coordinates so that the \\(x\\)-axis is co-directional with \\(\\vec{v}\\). This way, the notions of right/left and top/bottom are also introduced, according to the \\(x\\) - and \\(y\\)-coordinates, respectively.\n\nLet \\(B_{\\mathrm{T}}\\) and \\(B_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) be the top and the bottom vertices of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) (if several vertices are extremal, we take the rightmost of them). They split the perimeter of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) into the right part \\(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\) and the left part \\(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) (the vertices \\(B_{\\mathrm{T}}\\) and \\(B_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) are assumed to lie in both parts); each part forms a connected subset of the perimeter of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). So the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) are also split into two parts \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\), each of which consists of consecutive vertices.\n\nNow, all the points in \\(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\) (and hence in \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\) ) move out from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) under \\(t\\), since they are the rightmost points of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) on the corresponding horizontal lines. It remains to prove that the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) which stay in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) under \\(t\\) are consecutive.\n\nFor this purpose, let \\(C_{1}, C_{2}\\), and \\(C_{3}\\) be three vertices in \\(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\) such that \\(C_{2}\\) is between \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{3}\\), and \\(t\\left(C_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(t\\left(C_{3}\\right)\\) lie in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\); we need to prove that \\(t\\left(C_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{B}\\) as well. Let \\(A_{i}=t\\left(C_{i}\\right)\\). The line through \\(C_{2}\\) parallel to \\(\\vec{v}\\) crosses the segment \\(C_{1} C_{3}\\) to the right of \\(C_{2}\\); this means that this line crosses \\(A_{1} A_{3}\\) to the right of \\(A_{2}\\), so \\(A_{2}\\) lies inside the triangle \\(A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}\\) which is contained in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). This yields the desired result.\n\nCase 2: \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is a homothetic image of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) centered at \\(X\\) with factor \\(k>0\\).\n\nDenote by \\(h\\) the homothety mapping \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) to \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). We need now to prove that the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) which stay in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) after applying \\(h\\) are consecutive. If \\(X \\in \\mathcal{B}\\), the claim is easy. Indeed, if \\(k<1\\), then the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) lie on the segments of the form \\(X C\\) ( \\(C\\) being a vertex of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) ) which lie in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). If \\(k>1\\), then the vertices of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) lie on the extensions of such segments \\(X C\\) beyond \\(C\\), and almost all these extensions lie outside \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). The exceptions may occur only in case when \\(X\\) lies on the boundary of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), and they may cause one or two vertices of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) stay on the boundary of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). But even in this case those vertices are still consecutive.\n\nSo, from now on we assume that \\(X \\notin \\mathcal{B}\\).\nNow, there are two vertices \\(B_{\\mathrm{T}}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is contained in the angle \\(\\angle B_{\\mathrm{T}} X B_{\\mathrm{B}}\\); if there are several options, say, for \\(B_{\\mathrm{T}}\\), then we choose the farthest one from \\(X\\) if \\(k>1\\), and the nearest one if \\(k<1\\). For the visualization purposes, we refer the plane to Cartesian coordinates so that the \\(y\\)-axis is co-directional with \\(\\overrightarrow{B_{\\mathrm{B}} B_{\\mathrm{T}}}\\), and \\(X\\) lies to the left of the line \\(B_{\\mathrm{T}} B_{\\mathrm{B}}\\).

It follows that the sequence is eventually strictly increasing, so it is not eventually periodic.\nProof. A square cannot be congruent to -1 modulo 3 , so \\(a_{n} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)\\) implies that \\(a_{n}\\) is not a square, therefore \\(a_{n+1}=a_{n}+3>a_{n}\\). As a consequence, \\(a_{n+1} \\equiv a_{n} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)\\), so \\(a_{n+1}\\) is not a square either.

If \\(a_{n} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 3)\\), then there is an index \\(m>n\\) such that \\(a_{m}=3\\).\nProof. First we notice that, by the definition of the sequence, a multiple of 3 is always followed by another multiple of 3 .

It follows that \\(a_{j} \\in\\{3,6,9\\}\\), and the proof is complete.\nClaim 4. If \\(a_{n} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)\\), then there is an index \\(m>n\\) such that \\(a_{m} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)\\).\nProof. In the sequence, 4 is always followed by \\(2 \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)\\), so the claim is true for \\(a_{n}=4\\). If \\(a_{n}=7\\), the next terms will be \\(10,13,16,4,2, \\ldots\\) and the claim is also true. For \\(a_{n} \\geqslant 10\\), we again take an index \\(j>n\\) such that \\(a_{j}\\) is equal to the minimum value of the set \\(\\left\\{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \\ldots\\right\\}\\), which by the definition of the sequence consists of non-multiples of 3 . Suppose \\(a_{j} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)\\). Then we must have \\(a_{j} \\leqslant 9\\) by Claim 2 and the minimality of \\(a_{j}\\). It follows that \\(a_{j} \\in\\{4,7\\}\\), so \\(a_{m}=2<a_{j}\\) for some \\(m>j\\), contradicting the minimality of \\(a_{j}\\). Therefore, we must have \\(a_{j} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)\\).\n\nIt follows from the previous claims that if \\(a_{0}\\) is a multiple of 3 the sequence will eventually reach the periodic pattern \\(3,6,9,3,6,9, \\ldots\\); if \\(a_{0} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)\\) the sequence will be strictly increasing; and if \\(a_{0} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)\\) the sequence will be eventually strictly increasing.\n\nSo the sequence will be eventually periodic if, and only if, \\(a_{0}\\) is a multiple of 3 ."}

In the other case, we have \\(x_{k} y_{n} \\equiv x_{n} y_{k} \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)\\), If, say \\(p \\mid x_{k}\\), then \\(p \\nmid y_{k}\\) because ( \\(x_{k}, y_{k}\\) ) is irreducible, so \\(p \\mid x_{n}\\); then \\(p \\nmid y_{n}\\) because ( \\(x_{k}, y_{k}\\) ) is irreducible.

It is possible to show that there is no constant \\(C\\) for which, given any two irreducible lattice points, there is some homogenous polynomial \\(f\\) of degree at most \\(C\\) with integer coefficients that takes the value 1 on the two points.

So there exists a unique such pair \\((u, v)\\) with \\(-b / 2<u \\leqslant b / 2\\); we denote this pair by \\((u, v)=g(a, b)\\).\nLemma. Let \\((a, b) \\in \\mathbb{A}\\) and \\((u, v)=g(a, b)\\).

We know from Case 1 that \\(g(b-a, a)=(v, u+v)\\). We have \\(f(b-a, a)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow v \\leqslant 0\\) by the inductive hypothesis. Then, since \\(b>a \\geqslant 1\\) and \\(u a+v b=1\\), we have \\(v \\leqslant 0 \\Longleftrightarrow u>0\\), and we are done.\n\nThe Lemma proves that, for all \\((a, b) \\in \\mathbb{A}, f(a, b)=1\\) if and only if the inverse of \\(a\\) modulo \\(b\\), taken in \\(\\{1,2, \\ldots, b-1\\}\\), is at most \\(b / 2\\).

We provide a different proof for the Lemma. For this purpose, we use continued fractions to find \\(g(a, b)=(u, v)\\) explicitly.\n\nThe function \\(f\\) is completely determined on \\(\\mathbb{A}\\) by the following\nClaim. Represent \\(a / b\\) as a continued fraction; that is, let \\(a_{0}\\) be an integer and \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\) be positive integers such that \\(a_{k} \\geqslant 2\\) and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b}=a_{0}+\\frac{1}{a_{1}+\\frac{1}{a_{2}+\\frac{1}{\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_{k}}}}}=\\left[a_{0} ; a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right] .\n\\]\n\nThen \\(f(a, b)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow k\\) is even.\nProof. We induct on \\(b\\). If \\(b=1\\), then \\(a / b=[a]\\) and \\(k=0\\). Then, for \\(a \\geqslant 1\\), an easy induction shows that \\(f(a, 1)=f(1,1)=0\\).\n\nNow consider the case \\(b>1\\). Perform the Euclidean division \\(a=q b+r\\), with \\(0 \\leqslant r<b\\). We have \\(r \\neq 0\\) because \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1\\). Hence\n\n\\[\nf(a, b)=f(r, b)=1-f(b, r), \\quad \\frac{a}{b}=\\left[q ; a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right], \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{b}{r}=\\left[a_{1} ; a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThen the number of terms in the continued fraction representations of \\(a / b\\) and \\(b / r\\) differ by one. Since \\(r<b\\), the inductive hypothesis yields\n\n\\[\nf(b, r)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow k-1 \\text { is even, }\n\\]\n\nand thus\n\n\\[\nf(a, b)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow f(b, r)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow k-1 \\text { is odd } \\Longleftrightarrow k \\text { is even. }\n\\]\n\nNow we use the following well-known properties of continued fractions to prove the Lemma:\nLet \\(p_{i}\\) and \\(q_{i}\\) be coprime positive integers with \\(\\left[a_{0} ; a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{i}\\right]=p_{i} / q_{i}\\), with the notation borrowed from the Claim. In particular, \\(a / b=\\left[a_{0} ; a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right]=p_{k} / q_{k}\\). Assume that \\(k>0\\) and define \\(q_{-1}=0\\) if necessary. Then\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\(q_{k}=a_{k} q_{k-1}+q_{k-2}\\), and\n  \\item \\(a q_{k-1}-b p_{k-1}=p_{k} q_{k-1}-q_{k} p_{k-1}=(-1)^{k-1}\\).\n\n\nAssume that \\(k>0\\). Then \\(a_{k} \\geqslant 2\\), and\n\n\\[\nb=q_{k}=a_{k} q_{k-1}+q_{k-2} \\geqslant a_{k} q_{k-1} \\geqslant 2 q_{k-1} \\Longrightarrow q_{k-1} \\leqslant \\frac{b}{2},\n\\]\n\nwith strict inequality for \\(k>1\\), and\n\n\\[\n(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1} a+(-1)^{k} p_{k-1} b=1\n\\]\n\nNow we finish the proof of the Lemma. It is immediate for \\(k=0\\). If \\(k=1\\), then \\((-1)^{k-1}=1\\), so\n\n\\[\n-b / 2<0 \\leqslant(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1} \\leqslant b / 2 .\n\\]\n\nIf \\(k>1\\), we have \\(q_{k-1}<b / 2\\), so\n\n\\[\n-b / 2<(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1}<b / 2 .\n\\]\n\nThus, for any \\(k>0\\), we find that \\(g(a, b)=\\left((-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1},(-1)^{k} p_{k-1}\\right)\\), and so\n\n\\[\nf(a, b)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow k \\text { is odd } \\Longleftrightarrow u=(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1}>0\n\\]\n\nComment 1. The Lemma can also be established by observing that \\(f\\) is uniquely defined on \\(\\mathbb{A}\\), defining \\(f_{1}(a, b)=1\\) if \\(u>0\\) in \\(g(a, b)=(u, v)\\) and \\(f_{1}(a, b)=0\\) otherwise, and verifying that \\(f_{1}\\) satisfies all the conditions from the statement.\n\nIt seems that the main difficulty of the problem is in conjecturing the Lemma.\nComment 2. The case \\(p \\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)\\) is, in fact, easier than the original problem. We have, in general, for \\(1 \\leqslant a \\leqslant p-1\\),\n\\(f(a, p)=1-f(p, a)=1-f(p-a, a)=f(a, p-a)=f(a+(p-a), p-a)=f(p, p-a)=1-f(p-a, p)\\).\nIf \\(p \\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)\\), then \\(a\\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\) if and only if \\(p-a\\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\). Therefore, denoting by \\(r_{k}\\) (with \\(1 \\leqslant r_{k} \\leqslant p-1\\) ) the remainder of the division of \\(k^{2}\\) by \\(p\\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right)=\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(r_{n}, p\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\\left(f\\left(r_{n}, p\\right)+f\\left(p-r_{n}, p\\right)\\right)=\\frac{p-1}{2}\n\\]\n\nComment 3. The estimate for the sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{p} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right)\\) can be improved by refining the final argument in Solution 1. In fact, one can prove that\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right) \\geqslant \\frac{p-1}{16}\n\\]\n\nBy counting the number of perfect squares in the intervals \\([k p,(k+1 / 2) p)\\), we find that\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right)=\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{\\left(k+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) p}\\right\\rfloor-\\lfloor\\sqrt{k p}\\rfloor\\right)\n\\]\n\nEach summand of (2) is non-negative. We now estimate the number of positive summands. Suppose that a summand is zero, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{\\left(k+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) p}\\right\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\sqrt{k p}\\rfloor=: q\n\\]\n\nThen both of the numbers \\(k p\\) and \\(k p+p / 2\\) lie within the interval \\(\\left[q^{2},(q+1)^{2}\\right)\\). Hence\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{2}<(q+1)^{2}-q^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhich implies\n\n\\[\nq \\geqslant \\frac{p-1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(q \\leqslant \\sqrt{k p}\\), if the \\(k^{\\text {th }}\\) summand of (2) is zero, then\n\n\\[\nk \\geqslant \\frac{q^{2}}{p} \\geqslant \\frac{(p-1)^{2}}{16 p}>\\frac{p-2}{16} \\Longrightarrow k \\geqslant \\frac{p-1}{16}\n\\]\n\nSo at least the first \\(\\left\\lceil\\frac{p-1}{16}\\right\\rceil\\) summands (from \\(k=0\\) to \\(k=\\left\\lceil\\frac{p-1}{16}\\right\\rceil-1\\) ) are positive, and the result follows.\n\nComment 4. The bound can be further improved by using different methods. In fact, we prove that\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right) \\geqslant \\frac{p-3}{4}\n\\]\n\nTo that end, we use the Legendre symbol\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)= \\begin{cases}0 & \\text { if } p \\mid a \\\\ 1 & \\text { if } a \\text { is a nonzero quadratic residue } \\bmod p \\\\ -1 & \\text { otherwise }\n\\]\n\nWe start with the following Claim, which tells us that there are not too many consecutive quadratic residues or consecutive quadratic non-residues.\n\nClaim. \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=-1\\).\nProof. We have \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{p}\\right)\\). For \\(1 \\leqslant n \\leqslant p-1\\), we get that \\(n(n+1) \\equiv n^{2}\\left(1+n^{-1}\\right)(\\bmod p)\\), hence \\(\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{p}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1+n^{-1}}{p}\\right)\\). Since \\(\\left\\{1+n^{-1} \\bmod p: 1 \\leqslant n \\leqslant p-1\\right\\}=\\{0,2,3, \\ldots, p-1 \\bmod p\\}\\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\\left(\\frac{1+n^{-1}}{p}\\right)=\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)-1=-1,\n\\]\n\nbecause \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{p}\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)=0\\).\nObserve that (1) becomes\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right)=2|S|, \\quad S=\\left\\{r: 1 \\leqslant r \\leqslant \\frac{p-1}{2} \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{r}{p}\\right)=1\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nWe connect \\(S\\) with the sum from the claim by pairing quadratic residues and quadratic non-residues. To that end, define\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS^{\\prime} & =\\left\\{r: 1 \\leqslant r \\leqslant \\frac{p-1}{2} \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{r}{p}\\right)=-1\\right\\} \nT & =\\left\\{r: \\frac{p+1}{2} \\leqslant r \\leqslant p-1 \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{r}{p}\\right)=1\\right\\} \nT^{\\prime} & =\\left\\{r: \\frac{p+1}{2} \\leqslant r \\leqslant p-1 \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{r}{p}\\right)=-1\\right\\}\n\n\\]\n\nSince there are exactly \\((p-1) / 2\\) nonzero quadratic residues modulo \\(p,|S|+|T|=(p-1) / 2\\). Also we obviously have \\(|T|+\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right|=(p-1) / 2\\). Then \\(|S|=\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right|\\).\n\nFor the sake of brevity, define \\(t=|S|=\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right|\\). If \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=-1\\), then exactly of one the numbers \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)\\) is equal to 1 , so\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lvert\\,\\left\\{n: 1 \\leqslant n \\leqslant \\frac{p-3}{2} \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=-1\\right\\}|\\leqslant|S|+|S-1|=2 t\\right.\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, if \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=-1\\), then exactly one of \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)\\) is equal to -1 , and\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lvert\\,\\left\\{n: \\frac{p+1}{2} \\leqslant n \\leqslant p-2 \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=-1\\right\\}\\left|\\leqslant\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right|+\\left|T^{\\prime}-1\\right|=2 t .\\right.\\right.\n\\]\n\nThus, taking into account that the middle term \\(\\left(\\frac{(p-1) / 2}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{(p+1) / 2}{p}\\right)\\) may happen to be -1 ,\n\n\\[\n\\left.\\left\\lvert\\,\\left\\{n: 1 \\leqslant n \\leqslant p-2 \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=-1\\right\\}\\right. \\right\\rvert\\, \\leqslant 4 t+1\n\\]\n\nThis implies that\n\n\\[\n\\left.\\left\\lvert\\,\\left\\{n: 1 \\leqslant n \\leqslant p-2 \\text { and }\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right)=1\\right\\}\\right. \\right\\rvert\\, \\geqslant(p-2)-(4 t+1)=p-4 t-3\n\\]\n\nand so\n\n\\[\n-1=\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{p}\\right) \\geqslant p-4 t-3-(4 t+1)=p-8 t-4\n\\]\n\nwhich implies \\(8 t \\geqslant p-3\\), and thus\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right)=2 t \\geqslant \\frac{p-3}{4}\n\\]\n\nComment 5.

Let \\(x, y\\) be nonnegative integers such that \\(-1<\\psi x+y<\\varphi\\). Then there exists a subset \\(J\\) of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{j \\in J} \\psi^{j-1}\n\\]\n\nProof. For \\(x=y=0\\) it suffices to choose the empty subset of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) as \\(J\\), so let at least one of \\(x, y\\) be nonzero. There exist representations of \\(\\psi x+y\\) of the form\n\n\\[\n\\psi x+y=\\psi^{i_{1}}+\\cdots+\\psi^{i_{k}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(i_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq i_{k}\\) is a sequence of nonnegative integers, not necessarily distinct. For instance, we can take \\(x\\) summands \\(\\psi^{1}=\\psi\\) and \\(y\\) summands \\(\\psi^{0}=1\\). Consider all such representations of minimum length \\(k\\) and focus on the ones for which \\(i_{1}\\) has the minimum possible value \\(j_{1}\\). Among them, consider the representations where \\(i_{2}\\) has the minimum possible value \\(j_{2}\\). Upon choosing \\(j_{3}, \\ldots, j_{k}\\) analogously, we obtain a sequence \\(j_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq j_{k}\\) which clearly satisfies \\(\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}\\). To prove the lemma, it suffices to show that \\(j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{k}\\) are pairwise distinct.\n\nSuppose on the contrary that \\(j_{r}=j_{r+1}\\) for some \\(r=1, \\ldots, k-1\\). Let us consider the case \\(j_{r} \\geq 2\\) first. Observing that \\(2 \\psi^{2}=1+\\psi^{3}\\), we replace \\(j_{r}\\) and \\(j_{r+1}\\) by \\(j_{r}-2\\) and \\(j_{r}+1\\), respectively. Since\n\n\\[\n\\psi^{j_{r}}+\\psi^{j_{r+1}}=2 \\psi^{j_{r}}=\\psi^{j_{r}-2}\\left(1+\\psi^{3}\\right)=\\psi^{j_{r}-2}+\\psi^{j_{r}+1}\n\\]\n\nthe new sequence also represents \\(\\psi x+y\\) as needed, and the value of \\(i_{r}\\) in it contradicts the minimum choice of \\(j_{r}\\).\n\nLet \\(j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0\\). Then the sum \\(\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}\\) contains at least two summands equal to \\(\\psi^{0}=1\\). On the other hand \\(j_{s} \\neq 1\\) for all \\(s\\), because the equality \\(1+\\psi=\\psi^{2}\\) implies that a representation of minimum length cannot contain consecutive \\(i_{r}\\) 's. It follows that\n\n\\[\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}>2+\\psi^{3}+\\psi^{5}+\\psi^{7}+\\cdots=2-\\psi^{2}=\\varphi\n\\]\n\ncontradicting the condition of the lemma.\nLet \\(j_{r}=j_{r+1}=1\\); then \\(\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}\\) contains at least two summands equal to \\(\\psi^{1}=\\psi\\). Like in the case \\(j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0\\), we also infer that \\(j_{s} \\neq 0\\) and \\(j_{s} \\neq 2\\) for all \\(s\\). Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}<2 \\psi+\\psi^{4}+\\psi^{6}+\\psi^{8}+\\cdots=2 \\psi-\\psi^{3}=-1\n\\]\n\nwhich is a contradiction again. The conclusion follows.\nNow let the ordered pair \\((x, y)\\) satisfy \\(-1<\\psi x+y<\\varphi\\); hence the lemma applies to \\((x, y)\\). Let \\(J \\subset \\mathbb{N}\\) be such that (2) holds. Comparing (1) and (2), we conclude that \\(\\psi x+y=\\psi a_{J}+b_{J}\\). Now, \\(x, y, a_{J}\\) and \\(b_{J}\\) are integers, and \\(\\psi\\) is irrational. So the last equality implies \\(x=a_{J}\\) and \\(y=b_{J}\\). This shows that the numbers \\(\\alpha=\\psi, \\beta=1, m=-1, M=\\varphi\\) meet the requirements.\nComment. We present another way to prove the lemma, constructing the set \\(J\\) inductively. For \\(x=y=0\\), choose \\(J=\\emptyset\\). We induct on \\(n=3 x+2 y\\). Suppose that an appropriate set \\(J\\) exists when \\(3 x+2 y<n\\). Now assume \\(3 x+2 y=n>0\\). The current set \\(J\\) should be\n\n\\[\n\\text { either } \\quad 1 \\leq j_{1}<j_{2}<\\cdots<j_{k} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad j_{1}=0,1 \\leq j_{2}<\\cdots<j_{k}\n\\]\n\nThese sets fulfil the condition if\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\psi x+y}{\\psi}=\\psi^{i_{1}-1}+\\cdots+\\psi^{i_{k}-1} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\frac{\\psi x+y-1}{\\psi}=\\psi^{i_{2}-1}+\\cdots+\\psi^{i_{k}-1}\n\\]\n\nrespectively; therefore it suffices to find an appropriate set for \\(\\frac{\\psi x+y}{\\psi}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\psi x+y-1}{\\psi}\\), respectively.\nConsider \\(\\frac{\\psi x+y}{\\psi}\\). Knowing that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\psi x+y}{\\psi}=x+(\\psi-1) y=\\psi y+(x-y)\n\\]\n\nlet \\(x^{\\prime}=y, y^{\\prime}=x-y\\) and test the induction hypothesis on these numbers. We require \\(\\frac{\\psi x+y}{\\psi} \\in(-1, \\varphi)\\) which is equivalent to\n\n\\[\n\\psi x+y \\in(\\varphi \\cdot \\psi,(-1) \\cdot \\psi)=(-1,-\\psi)\n\\]\n\nRelation (3) implies \\(y^{\\prime}=x-y \\geq-\\psi x-y>\\psi>-1\\); therefore \\(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime} \\geq 0\\). Moreover, we have \\(3 x^{\\prime}+2 y^{\\prime}=2 x+y \\leq \\frac{2}{3} n\\); therefore, if (3) holds then the induction applies: the numbers \\(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}\\) are represented in the form as needed, hence \\(x, y\\) also.\n\nNow consider \\(\\frac{\\psi x+y-1}{\\psi}\\). Since\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\psi x+y-1}{\\psi}=x+(\\psi-1)(y-1)=\\psi(y-1)+(x-y+1)\n\\]\n\nwe set \\(x^{\\prime}=y-1\\) and \\(y^{\\prime}=x-y+1\\). Again we require that \\(\\frac{\\psi x+y-1}{\\psi} \\in(-1, \\varphi)\\), i.e.\n\n\\[\n\\psi x+y \\in(\\varphi \\cdot \\psi+1,(-1) \\cdot \\psi+1)=(0, \\varphi)\n\\]\n\nIf (4) holds then \\(y-1 \\geq \\psi x+y-1>-1\\) and \\(x-y+1 \\geq-\\psi x-y+1>-\\varphi+1>-1\\), therefore \\(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime} \\geq 0\\). Moreover, \\(3 x^{\\prime}+2 y^{\\prime}=2 x+y-1<\\frac{2}{3} n\\) and the induction works.\n\nFinally, \\((-1,-\\psi) \\cup(0, \\varphi)=(-1, \\varphi)\\) so at least one of (3) and (4) holds and the induction step is justified."}

There are several ways to prove that the right-hand side of (2) never exceeds 9 (and this is just what we need). One of them is to introduce new variables \\(x, y, z\\), as in Solution 1, which upon some manipulation brings the problem again to inequality (1).\n\nAlternatively, the claim that right-hand side of (2) is not greater than 9 can be expressed in terms of the symmetric forms \\(\\sigma_{1}=\\sum x, \\sigma_{2}=\\sum x y, \\sigma_{3}=x y z\\) equivalently as\n\n\\[\n4 \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2} \\sigma_{3} \\leq \\sigma_{2}^{3}+9 \\sigma_{3}^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhich is a known inequality. A yet different method to deal with the right-hand expression in (2) is to consider \\(\\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{c}\\) as sides of a triangle.

Again, (4) is another known inequality. Note that the inequalities (1), (3), (4) are equivalent statements about the same mathematical situation.\n\nSolution 2. Due to the symmetry of variables, it can be assumed that \\(a \\geq b \\geq c\\).

This is indeed the case, and more precisely: let \\(A_{k}\\) be the \\(2^{k} \\times 2^{k}\\) matrix whose rows represent the evolution of the system, with entries 0,1 (for off and on respectively). The top row shows the initial state \\([1,0,0, \\ldots, 0]\\); the bottom row shows the state after \\(2^{k}-1\\) steps. The claim is that:\n\n\\[\n\\text { The bottom row of } A_{k} \\text { is }[1,1,1, \\ldots, 1] \\text {. }\n\\]\n\nThis will of course suffice because one more move then produces \\([0,0,0, \\ldots, 0]\\), as required.\nThe proof is by induction on \\(k\\). The base \\(k=1\\) is obvious. Assume the claim to be true for a \\(k \\geq 1\\) and write the matrix \\(A_{k+1}\\) in the block form \\(\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}A_{k} & O_{k} \\\\ B_{k} & C_{k}\\right)\\) with four \\(2^{k} \\times 2^{k}\\) matrices. After \\(m\\) steps, the last 1 in a row is at position \\(m+1\\). Therefore \\(O_{k}\\) is the zero matrix. According to the induction hypothesis, the bottom row of \\(\\left[A_{k} O_{k}\\right]\\) is \\([1, \\ldots, 1,0, \\ldots, 0]\\), with \\(2^{k}\\) ones and \\(2^{k}\\) zeros. The next row is thus\n\n\\[\n[\\underbrace{0, \\ldots, 0}_{2^{k}-1}, 1,1, \\underbrace{0, \\ldots, 0}_{2^{k}-1}]\n\\]\n\nIt is symmetric about its midpoint, and this symmetry is preserved in all subsequent rows because the procedure described in the problem statement is left/right symmetric. Thus \\(B_{k}\\) is the mirror image of \\(C_{k}\\). In particular, the rightmost column of \\(B_{k}\\) is identical with the leftmost column of \\(C_{k}\\).\n\nImagine the matrix \\(C_{k}\\) in isolation from the rest of \\(A_{k+1}\\). Suppose it is subject to evolution as defined in the problem: the first (leftmost) term in a row depends only on the two first terms in the preceding row, according as they are equal or not. Now embed \\(C_{k}\\) again in \\(A_{k}\\). The 'leftmost' terms in the rows of \\(C_{k}\\) now have neighbours on their left side-but these neighbours are their exact copies. Consequently the actual evolution within \\(C_{k}\\) is the same, whether or not \\(C_{k}\\) is considered as a piece of \\(A_{k+1}\\) or in isolation. And since the top row of \\(C_{k}\\) is \\([1,0, \\ldots, 0]\\), it follows that \\(C_{k}\\) is identical with \\(A_{k}\\).\n\nThe bottom row of \\(A_{k}\\) is \\([1,1, \\ldots, 1]\\); the same is the bottom row of \\(C_{k}\\), hence also of \\(B_{k}\\), which mirrors \\(C_{k}\\). So the bottom row of \\(A_{k+1}\\) consists of ones only and the induction is complete.\n(b) There are many ways to produce an infinite sequence of those \\(n\\) for which the state \\([0,0, \\ldots, 0]\\) will never be achieved. As an example, consider \\(n=2^{k}+1\\) (for \\(k \\geq 1\\) ). The evolution of the system can be represented by a matrix \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of width \\(2^{k}+1\\) with infinitely many rows. The top \\(2^{k}\\) rows form the matrix \\(A_{k}\\) discussed above, with one column of zeros attached at its right.\n\nIn the next row we then have the vector \\([0,0, \\ldots, 0,1,1]\\). But this is just the second row of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) reversed. Subsequent rows will be mirror copies of the foregoing ones, starting from the second one. So the configuration \\([1,1,0, \\ldots, 0,0]\\), i.e. the second row of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), will reappear. Further rows will periodically repeat this pattern and there will be no row of zeros."}

Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity.\nLemma. Let \\(A B\\) be one of dissecting diagonals and let \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints \\(A, B\\). Suppose that \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) consists of \\(n\\) segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) does not exceed \\(n / 2\\).\nProof. This is obvious for \\(n=2\\). Take \\(n\\) with \\(2<n \\leq 1003\\) and assume the claim to be true for every \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) of length less than \\(n\\). Let now \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) (endpoints \\(A, B\\) ) consist of \\(n\\) segments. Let \\(P Q\\) be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle \\(P Q S\\) with all vertices on \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is obtuse or right-angled; thus \\(S\\) is the summit of \\(P Q S\\). We may assume that the five points \\(A, P, S, Q, B\\) lie on \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) in this order and partition \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) into four pieces \\(\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}\\) (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of \\(P Q\\), an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both \\(\\mathcal{L}_{A P}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}\\). Therefore every iso-odd triangle within \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) other than \\(P Q S\\) does not exceed \\(n / 2\\). And since each of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}\\) consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a \\(1 / 2+1 / 2\\) in excess. Hence the triangle \\(P S Q\\) is also covered by the estimate \\(n / 2\\). This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal \\(X Y\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}\\) be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints \\(X, Y\\) and let \\(X Y Z\\) be the triangle in the dissection with vertex \\(Z\\) not on \\(\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}\\). Notice that \\(X Y Z\\) is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments \\(X Z, Y Z\\) would be longer than \\(X Y\\). Denoting by \\(\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}\\) the two pieces defined by \\(Z\\) and applying the lemma to each of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}\\) we infer that there are no more than \\(2006 / 2\\) iso-odd triangles in all, unless \\(X Y Z\\) is one of them. But in that case \\(X Z\\) and \\(Y Z\\) are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including \\(X Y Z\\), is not greater than 1003 .\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion.\n\nSolution 2. Let the terms odd triangle and iso-odd triangle have the same meaning as in the first solution.\n\nLet \\(A B C\\) be an iso-odd triangle, with \\(A B\\) and \\(B C\\) odd sides. This means that there are an odd number of sides of the 2006-gon between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and also between \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle \\(A B C\\).\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle \\(A B C\\).\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side. It follows that at most 1003 iso-odd triangles can appear in the dissection.\n\nThis value can be attained, as shows the example from the first solution."}

We show that an ( \\(n, k\\) )-tournament exists if and only if \\(2^{t_{k}}\\) divides \\(n\\).\n\nFirst we prove that if \\(n=2^{t}\\) for some \\(t\\) then there is an ( \\(n, k\\) )-tournament for all \\(k \\leq 2^{t}-1\\). Let \\(S\\) be the set of \\(0-1\\) sequences with length \\(t\\). We label the \\(2^{t}\\) players with the elements of \\(S\\) in an arbitrary fashion (which is possible as there are exactly \\(2^{t}\\) sequences in \\(S\\) ). Players are identified with their labels in the construction below. If \\(\\alpha, \\beta \\in S\\), let \\(\\alpha+\\beta \\in S\\) be the result of the modulo 2 term-by-term addition of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (with rules \\(0+0=0,0+1=1+0=1\\), \\(1+1=0\\); there is no carryover). For each \\(i=1, \\ldots, 2^{t}-1\\) let \\(\\omega(i) \\in S\\) be the sequence of base 2 digits of \\(i\\), completed with leading zeros if necessary to achieve length \\(t\\).\n\nNow define a tournament with \\(n=2^{t}\\) players in \\(k \\leq 2^{t}-1\\) rounds as follows: For all \\(i=1, \\ldots, k\\), let player \\(\\alpha\\) meet player \\(\\alpha+\\omega(i)\\) in round \\(i\\). The tournament is well-defined as \\(\\alpha+\\omega(i) \\in S\\) and \\(\\alpha+\\omega(i)=\\beta+\\omega(i)\\) implies \\(\\alpha=\\beta\\); also \\([\\alpha+\\omega(i)]+\\omega(i)=\\alpha\\) for each \\(\\alpha \\in S\\) (meaning that player \\(\\alpha+\\omega(i)\\) meets player \\(\\alpha\\) in round \\(i\\), as needed). Each player plays in each round. Next, every two players meet at most once (exactly once if \\(k=2^{t}-1\\) ), since \\(\\omega(i) \\neq \\omega(j)\\) if \\(i \\neq j\\). Thus condition (i) holds true, and condition (ii) is also easy to check.\n\nLet player \\(\\alpha\\) meet player \\(\\beta\\) in round \\(i\\), player \\(\\gamma\\) meet player \\(\\delta\\) in round \\(i\\), and player \\(\\alpha\\) meet player \\(\\gamma\\) in round \\(j\\). Then \\(\\beta=\\alpha+\\omega(i), \\delta=\\gamma+\\omega(i)\\) and \\(\\gamma=\\alpha+\\omega(j)\\). By definition, \\(\\beta\\) will play in round \\(j\\) with\n\n\\[\n\\beta+\\omega(j)=[\\alpha+\\omega(i)]+\\omega(j)=[\\alpha+\\omega(j)]+\\omega(i)=\\gamma+\\omega(i)=\\delta,\n\\]\n\nas required by (ii).\nSo there exists an ( \\(n, k\\) )-tournament for pairs ( \\(n, k\\) ) such that \\(n=2^{t}\\) and \\(k \\leq 2^{t}-1\\). The same conclusion is straightforward for \\(n\\) of the form \\(n=2^{t} s\\) and \\(k \\leq 2^{t}-1\\). Indeed, consider \\(s\\) different \\(\\left(2^{t}, k\\right)\\)-tournaments \\(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}\\), no two of them having players in common. Their union can be regarded as a ( \\(2^{t} s, k\\) )-tournament \\(T\\) where each round is the union of the respective rounds in \\(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}\\).\n\nIn summary, the condition that \\(2^{t_{k}}\\) divides \\(n\\) is sufficient for an \\((n, k)\\)-tournament to exist. We prove that it is also necessary.\n\nConsider an arbitrary ( \\(n, k\\) )-tournament. Represent each player by a point and after each round, join by an edge every two players who played in this round. Thus to a round \\(i=1, \\ldots, k\\) there corresponds a graph \\(G_{i}\\). We say that player \\(Q\\) is an \\(i\\)-neighbour of player \\(P\\) if there is a path of edges in \\(G_{i}\\) from \\(P\\) to \\(Q\\); in other words, if there are players \\(P=X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{m}=Q\\) such that player \\(X_{j}\\) meets player \\(X_{j+1}\\) in one of the first \\(i\\) rounds, \\(j=1,2 \\ldots, m-1\\). The set of \\(i\\)-neighbours of a player will be called its \\(i\\)-component. Clearly two \\(i\\)-components are either disjoint or coincide.\n\nHence after each round \\(i\\) the set of players is partitioned into pairwise disjoint \\(i\\)-components. So, to achieve our goal, it suffices to show that all \\(k\\)-components have size divisible by \\(2^{t_{k}}\\).\n\nTo this end, let us see how the \\(i\\)-component \\(\\Gamma\\) of a player \\(A\\) changes after round \\(i+1\\). Suppose that \\(A\\) meets player \\(B\\) with \\(i\\)-component \\(\\Delta\\) in round \\(i+1\\) (components \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) are not necessarily distinct). We claim that then in round \\(i+1\\) each player from \\(\\Gamma\\) meets a player from \\(\\Delta\\), and vice versa.\n\nIndeed, let \\(C\\) be any player in \\(\\Gamma\\), and let \\(C\\) meet \\(D\\) in round \\(i+1\\). Since \\(C\\) is an \\(i\\)-neighbour of \\(A\\), there is a sequence of players \\(A=X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{m}=C\\) such that \\(X_{j}\\) meets \\(X_{j+1}\\) in one of the first \\(i\\) rounds, \\(j=1,2 \\ldots, m-1\\). Let \\(X_{j}\\) meet \\(Y_{j}\\) in round \\(i+1\\), for \\(j=1,2 \\ldots, m\\); in particular \\(Y_{1}=B\\) and \\(Y_{m}=D\\). Players \\(Y_{j}\\) exists in view of condition (i). Suppose that \\(X_{j}\\) and \\(X_{j+1}\\) met in round \\(r\\), where \\(r \\leq i\\). Then condition (ii) implies that and \\(Y_{j}\\) and \\(Y_{j+1}\\) met in round \\(r\\), too. Hence \\(B=Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \\ldots, Y_{m}=D\\) is a path in \\(G_{i}\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(D\\). This is to say, \\(D\\) is in the \\(i\\)-component \\(\\Delta\\) of \\(B\\), as claimed. By symmetry, each player from \\(\\Delta\\) meets a player from \\(\\Gamma\\) in round \\(i+1\\). It follows in particular that \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) have the same cardinality.\n\nIt is straightforward now that the \\((i+1)\\)-component of \\(A\\) is \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta\\), the union of two sets with the same size. Since \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) are either disjoint or coincide, we have either \\(|\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta|=2|\\Gamma|\\) or \\(|\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta|=|\\Gamma|\\); as usual, \\(|\\cdots|\\) denotes the cardinality of a finite set.\n\nLet \\(\\Gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\Gamma_{k}\\) be the consecutive components of a given player \\(A\\). We obtained that either \\(\\left|\\Gamma_{i+1}\\right|=2\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|\\) or \\(\\left|\\Gamma_{i+1}\\right|=\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|\\) for \\(i=1, \\ldots, k-1\\). Because \\(\\left|\\Gamma_{1}\\right|=2\\), each \\(\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|\\) is a power of 2 , \\(i=1, \\ldots, k-1\\). In particular \\(\\left|\\Gamma_{k}\\right|=2^{u}\\) for some \\(u\\).\n\nOn the other hand, player \\(A\\) has played with \\(k\\) different opponents by (i). All of them belong to \\(\\Gamma_{k}\\), therefore \\(\\left|\\Gamma_{k}\\right| \\geq k+1\\).\n\nThus \\(2^{u} \\geq k+1\\), and since \\(t_{k}\\) is the least integer satisfying \\(2^{t_{k}} \\geq k+1\\), we conclude that \\(u \\geq t_{k}\\). So the size of each \\(k\\)-component is divisible by \\(2^{t_{k}}\\), which completes the argument."}

The unit triangles in it will be called cells. We say simply \"triangle\" instead of \"upward equilateral triangle\" and \"size\" instead of \"side length.\"\n\nThe necessity will be proven first. Assume that a holey triangle \\(T\\) can be tiled with diamonds and consider such a tiling. Let \\(T^{\\prime}\\) be a triangle of size \\(k\\) in \\(T\\) containing \\(h\\) holes. Focus on the diamonds which cover (one or two) cells in \\(T^{\\prime}\\). Let them form a figure \\(R\\). The boundary of \\(T^{\\prime}\\) consists of upward cells, so \\(R\\) is a triangle of size \\(k\\) with \\(h\\) upward holes cut out and possibly some downward cells sticking out. Hence there are exactly \\(\\left(k^{2}+k\\right) / 2-h\\) upward cells in \\(R\\), and at least \\(\\left(k^{2}-k\\right) / 2\\) downward cells (not counting those sticking out). On the other hand each diamond covers one upward and one downward cell, which implies \\(\\left(k^{2}+k\\right) / 2-h \\geq\\left(k^{2}-k\\right) / 2\\). It follows that \\(h \\leq k\\), as needed.\n\nWe pass on to the sufficiency. For brevity, let us say that a set of holes in a given triangle \\(T\\) is spread out if every triangle of size \\(k\\) in \\(T\\) contains at most \\(k\\) holes. For any set \\(S\\) of spread out holes, a triangle of size \\(k\\) will be called full of \\(S\\) if it contains exactly \\(k\\) holes of \\(S\\). The proof is based on the following observation.\nLemma. Let \\(S\\) be a set of spread out holes in \\(T\\). Suppose that two triangles \\(T^{\\prime}\\) and \\(T^{\\prime \\prime}\\) are full of \\(S\\), and that they touch or intersect. Let \\(T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}\\) denote the smallest triangle in \\(T\\) containing them. Then \\(T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}\\) is also full of \\(S\\).\nProof. Let triangles \\(T^{\\prime}, T^{\\prime \\prime}, T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}\\) and \\(T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}\\) have sizes \\(a, b, c\\) and \\(d\\), and let them contain \\(a, b, x\\) and \\(y\\) holes of \\(S\\), respectively. (Note that \\(T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}\\) could be a point, in which case \\(c=0\\).) Since \\(S\\) is spread out, we have \\(x \\leq c\\) and \\(y \\leq d\\). The geometric configuration of triangles clearly satisfies \\(a+b=c+d\\). Furthermore, \\(a+b \\leq x+y\\), since \\(a+b\\) counts twice the holes in \\(T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}\\). These conclusions imply \\(x=c\\) and \\(y=d\\), as we wished to show.\n\nNow let \\(T_{n}\\) be a holey triangle of size \\(n\\), and let the set \\(H\\) of its holes be spread out. We show by induction on \\(n\\) that \\(T_{n}\\) can be tiled with diamonds. The base \\(n=1\\) is trivial. Suppose that \\(n \\geq 2\\) and that the claim holds for holey triangles of size less than \\(n\\).\n\nDenote by \\(B\\) the bottom row of \\(T_{n}\\) and by \\(T^{\\prime}\\) the triangle formed by its top \\(n-1\\) rows. There is at least one hole in \\(B\\) as \\(T^{\\prime}\\) contains at most \\(n-1\\) holes. If this hole is only one, there is a unique way to tile \\(B\\) with diamonds. Also, \\(T^{\\prime}\\) contains exactly \\(n-1\\) holes, making it a holey triangle of size \\(n-1\\), and these holes are spread out. Hence it remains to apply the induction hypothesis.\n\nSo suppose that there are \\(m \\geq 2\\) holes in \\(B\\) and label them \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m}\\) from left to right. Let \\(\\ell\\) be the line separating \\(B\\) from \\(T^{\\prime}\\). For each \\(i=1, \\ldots, m-1\\), pick an upward cell \\(b_{i}\\) between \\(a_{i}\\) and \\(a_{i+1}\\), with base on \\(\\ell\\). Place a diamond to cover \\(b_{i}\\) and its lower neighbour, a downward cell in \\(B\\). The remaining part of \\(B\\) can be tiled uniquely with diamonds. Remove from \\(T_{n}\\) row \\(B\\) and the cells \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}\\) to obtain a holey triangle \\(T_{n-1}\\) of size \\(n-1\\). The conclusion will follow by induction if the choice of \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}\\) guarantees that the following condition is satisfied: If the holes \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m-1}\\) are replaced by \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}\\) then the new set of holes is spread out again.\n\nWe show that such a choice is possible. The cells \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}\\) can be defined one at a time in this order, making sure that the above condition holds at each step. Thus it suffices to prove that there is an appropriate choice for \\(b_{1}\\), and we set \\(a_{1}=u, a_{2}=v\\) for clarity.\n\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be the triangle of maximum size which is full of \\(H\\), contains the top vertex of the hole \\(u\\), and has base on line \\(\\ell\\). Call \\(\\Delta\\) the associate of \\(u\\). Observe that \\(\\Delta\\) does not touch \\(v\\).\n\nIndeed, if \\(\\Delta\\) has size \\(r\\) then it contains \\(r\\) holes of \\(T_{n}\\). Extending its slanted sides downwards produces a triangle \\(\\Delta^{\\prime}\\) of size \\(r+1\\) containing at least one more hole, namely \\(u\\). Since there are at most \\(r+1\\) holes in \\(\\Delta^{\\prime}\\), it cannot contain \\(v\\). Consequently, \\(\\Delta\\) does not contain the top vertex of \\(v\\).\n\nLet \\(w\\) be the upward cell with base on \\(\\ell\\) which is to the right of \\(\\Delta\\) and shares a common vertex with it. The observation above shows that \\(w\\) is to the left of \\(v\\). Note that \\(w\\) is not a hole, or else \\(\\Delta\\) could be extended to a larger triangle full of \\(H\\).\n\nWe prove that if the hole \\(u\\) is replaced by \\(w\\) then the new set of holes is spread out again. To verify this, we only need to check that if a triangle \\(\\Gamma\\) in \\(T_{n}\\) contains \\(w\\) but not \\(u\\) then \\(\\Gamma\\) is not full of \\(H\\). Suppose to the contrary that \\(\\Gamma\\) is full of \\(H\\). Consider the minimum triangle \\(\\Gamma+\\Delta\\) containing \\(\\Gamma\\) and the associate \\(\\Delta\\) of \\(u\\). Clearly \\(\\Gamma+\\Delta\\) is larger than \\(\\Delta\\), because \\(\\Gamma\\) contains \\(w\\) but \\(\\Delta\\) does not. Next, \\(\\Gamma+\\Delta\\) is full of \\(H \\backslash\\{u\\}\\) by the lemma, since \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) have a common point and neither of them contains \\(u\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_b870456914a15f8830dfg-30}\n\nIf \\(\\Gamma\\) is above line \\(\\ell\\) then so is \\(\\Gamma+\\Delta\\), which contradicts the maximum choice of \\(\\Delta\\). If \\(\\Gamma\\) contains cells from row \\(B\\), observe that \\(\\Gamma+\\Delta\\) contains \\(u\\). Let \\(s\\) be the size of \\(\\Gamma+\\Delta\\). Being full of \\(H \\backslash\\{u\\}, \\Gamma+\\Delta\\) contains \\(s\\) holes other than \\(u\\). But it also contains \\(u\\), contradicting the assumption that \\(H\\) is spread out.\n\nThe claim follows, showing that \\(b_{1}=w\\) is an appropriate choice for \\(a_{1}=u\\) and \\(a_{2}=v\\). As explained above, this is enough to complete the induction."}

First note that by properties (a,b,c) above, the two regions cannot share only a single point or an arc. They are either disjoint or they overlap.\n\nAssume that the two regions have a common interior point \\(u\\). Let \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) be two parallel support planes of \\(\\Gamma\\) through points \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V_{j}\\), respectively, with normal vector \\(u\\). By the definition of regions \\(S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right), u\\) is the inward normal vector of \\(P_{1}\\) and the outward normal vector of \\(P_{2}\\). Therefore polyhedron \\(\\Gamma\\) lies between the two planes; vertices \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V_{j}\\) are antipodal.\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, assume that \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V_{j}\\) are antipodal. Then there exist two parallel support planes \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) through \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V_{j}\\), respectively, such that \\(\\Gamma\\) is between them. Let \\(u\\) be the inward normal vector of \\(P_{1}\\); then \\(u\\) is the outward normal vector of \\(P_{2}\\), therefore \\(u \\in S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right) \\cap S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)\\). The two regions have a common point, so they overlap.\nProof of lemma 2. Again, by properties (a,b) above, the endpoints of arc \\(S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)\\) cannot belong to \\(S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)\\) and vice versa. The two arcs are either disjoint or intersecting.\n\nAssume that arcs \\(S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)\\) intersect at point \\(u\\). Let \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) be the two support planes through edges \\(E_{i}\\) and \\(E_{j}\\), respectively, with normal vector \\(u\\). By the definition of arcs \\(S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)\\), vector \\(u\\) points inwards from \\(P_{1}\\) and outwards from \\(P_{2}\\). Therefore \\(\\Gamma\\) is between the planes. Since planes \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) pass through \\(Q_{i}\\) and \\(Q_{j}\\), these points are antipodal.\n\nFor the opposite direction, assume that points \\(Q_{i}\\) and \\(Q_{j}\\) are antipodal. Let \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) be two support planes through these points, respectively. An edge cannot intersect a support plane, therefore \\(E_{i}\\) and \\(E_{j}\\) lie in the planes \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\), respectively. Let \\(u\\) be the inward normal vector of \\(P_{1}\\), which is also the outward normal vector of \\(P_{2}\\). Then \\(u \\in S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right) \\cap S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)\\). So the two arcs are not disjoint; they therefore intersect.\n\nNow create a new decomposition of sphere \\(S\\). Draw all \\(\\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\\left(E_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(S^{-}\\left(E_{j}\\right)\\) on sphere \\(S\\) and put a knot at each point where two arcs meet. We have \\(\\ell\\) knots at points \\(S^{+}\\left(F_{i}\\right)\\) and another \\(\\ell\\) knots at points \\(S^{-}\\left(F_{i}\\right)\\), corresponding to the faces of \\(\\Gamma\\); by property (c) they are different. We also have some pairs \\(1 \\leq i, j \\leq m\\) where arcs \\(S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)\\) intersect. By Lemma 2, each antipodal pair ( \\(Q_{i}, Q_{j}\\) ) gives rise to two such intersections; hence, the number of all intersections is \\(2 B\\) and we have \\(2 \\ell+2 B\\) knots in all.\n\nEach intersection knot splits two arcs, increasing the number of arcs by 2 . Since we started with \\(2 m\\) arcs, corresponding the edges of \\(\\Gamma\\), the number of the resulting curve segments is \\(2 m+4 B\\).\n\nThe network of these curve segments divides the sphere into some \"new\" regions. Each new region is the intersection of some overlapping sets \\(S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)\\). Due to the convexity, the intersection of two overlapping regions is convex and thus contiguous. By Lemma 1, each pair of overlapping regions corresponds to an antipodal vertex pair and each antipodal vertex pair gives rise to two different overlaps, which are symmetric with respect to the origin. So the number of new regions is \\(2 A\\).\n\nThe result now follows from Euler's polyhedron theorem. We have \\(n+l=m+2\\) and\n\n\\[\n(2 \\ell+2 B)+2 A=(2 m+4 B)+2\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\nA-B=m-\\ell+1=n-1\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(A-B\\) is by one less than the number of vertices of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\nSolution 2. Use the same notations for the polyhedron and its vertices, edges and faces as in Solution 1. We regard points as vectors starting from the origin. Polyhedron \\(\\Gamma\\) is regarded as a closed convex set, including its interior. In some cases the edges and faces of \\(\\Gamma\\) are also regarded as sets of points. The symbol \\(\\partial\\) denotes the boundary of the certain set; e.g. \\(\\partial \\Gamma\\) is the surface of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\nLet \\(\\Delta=\\Gamma-\\Gamma=\\{U-V: U, V \\in \\Gamma\\}\\) be the set of vectors between arbitrary points of \\(\\Gamma\\). Then \\(\\Delta\\), being the sum of two bounded convex sets, is also a bounded convex set and, by construction, it is also centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. We will prove that \\(\\Delta\\) is also a polyhedron and express the numbers of its faces, edges and vertices in terms \\(n, m, \\ell, A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nLemma 1. For points \\(U, V \\in \\Gamma\\), point \\(W=U-V\\) is a boundary point of \\(\\Delta\\) if and only if \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are antipodal. Moreover, for each boundary point \\(W \\in \\partial \\Delta\\) there exists exactly one pair of points \\(U, V \\in \\Gamma\\) such that \\(W=U-V\\).\nProof. Assume first that \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are antipodal points of \\(\\Gamma\\). Let parallel support planes \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) pass through them such that \\(\\Gamma\\) is in between. Consider plane \\(P=P_{1}-U=\\) \\(P_{2}-V\\). This plane separates the interiors of \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(\\Gamma-V\\). After reflecting one of the sets, e.g. \\(\\Gamma-V\\), the sets \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(-\\Gamma+V\\) lie in the same half space bounded by \\(P\\). Then \\((\\Gamma-U)+(-\\Gamma+V)=\\Delta-W\\) lies in that half space, so \\(0 \\in P\\) is a boundary point of the set \\(\\Delta-W\\). Translating by \\(W\\) we obtain that \\(W\\) is a boundary point of \\(\\Delta\\).\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, let \\(W=U-V\\) be a boundary point of \\(\\Delta\\), and let \\(\\Psi=\\) \\((\\Gamma-U) \\cap(\\Gamma-V)\\). We claim that \\(\\Psi=\\{0\\}\\). Clearly \\(\\Psi\\) is a bounded convex set and \\(0 \\in \\Psi\\). For any two points \\(X, Y \\in \\Psi\\), we have \\(U+X, V+Y \\in \\Gamma\\) and \\(W+(X-Y)=(U+X)-(V+Y) \\in \\Delta\\). Since \\(W\\) is a boundary point of \\(\\Delta\\), the vector \\(X-Y\\) cannot have the same direction as \\(W\\). This implies that the interior of \\(\\Psi\\) is empty. Now suppose that \\(\\Psi\\) contains a line segment \\(S\\). Then \\(S+U\\) and \\(S+V\\) are subsets of some faces or edges of \\(\\Gamma\\) and these faces/edges are parallel to \\(S\\). In all cases, we find two faces, two edges, or a face and an edge which are parallel, contradicting the conditions of the problem. Therefore, \\(\\Psi=\\{0\\}\\) indeed.\n\nSince \\(\\Psi=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap(\\Gamma-V)\\) consists of a single point, the interiors of bodies \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(\\Gamma-V\\) are disjoint and there exists a plane \\(P\\) which separates them. Let \\(u\\) be the normal vector of \\(P\\) pointing into that half space bounded by \\(P\\) which contains \\(\\Gamma-U\\). Consider the planes \\(P+U\\) and \\(P+V\\); they are support planes of \\(\\Gamma\\), passing through \\(U\\) and \\(V\\), respectively. From plane \\(P+U\\), the vector \\(u\\) points into that half space which contains \\(\\Gamma\\). From plane \\(P+V\\), vector \\(u\\) points into the opposite half space containing \\(\\Gamma\\). Therefore, we found two proper support through points \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) such that \\(\\Gamma\\) is in between.\n\nFor the uniqueness part, assume that there exist points \\(U_{1}, V_{1} \\in \\Gamma\\) such that \\(U_{1}-V_{1}=U-V\\). The points \\(U_{1}-U\\) and \\(V_{1}-V\\) lie in the sets \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(\\Gamma-V\\) separated by \\(P\\). Since \\(U_{1}-U=V_{1}-V\\), this can happen only if both are in \\(P\\); but the only such point is 0 . Therefore, \\(U_{1}-V_{1}=U-V\\) implies \\(U_{1}=U\\) and \\(V_{1}=V\\). The lemma is complete.\n\nLemma 2. Let \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) be two antipodal points and assume that plane \\(P\\), passing through 0 , separates the interiors of \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(\\Gamma-V\\). Let \\(\\Psi_{1}=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap P\\) and \\(\\Psi_{2}=(\\Gamma-V) \\cap P\\). Then \\(\\Delta \\cap(P+U-V)=\\Psi_{1}-\\Psi_{2}+U-V\\).\nProof. The sets \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(-\\Gamma+V\\) lie in the same closed half space bounded by \\(P\\). Therefore, for any points \\(X \\in(\\Gamma-U)\\) and \\(Y \\in(-\\Gamma+V)\\), we have \\(X+Y \\in P\\) if and only if \\(X, Y \\in P\\). Then\n\\((\\Delta-(U-V)) \\cap P=((\\Gamma-U)+(-\\Gamma+V)) \\cap P=((\\Gamma-U) \\cap P)+((-\\Gamma+V) \\cap P)=\\Psi_{1}-\\Psi_{2}\\).\nNow a translation by ( \\(U-V\\) ) completes the lemma.\n\nNow classify the boundary points \\(W=U-V\\) of \\(\\Delta\\), according to the types of points \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). In all cases we choose a plane \\(P\\) through 0 which separates the interiors of \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(\\Gamma-V\\). We will use the notation \\(\\Psi_{1}=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap P\\) and \\(\\Psi_{2}=(\\Gamma-V) \\cap P\\) as well.\n\nCase 1: Both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are vertices of \\(\\Gamma\\). Bodies \\(\\Gamma-U\\) and \\(\\Gamma-V\\) have a common vertex which is 0 . Choose plane \\(P\\) in such a way that \\(\\Psi_{1}=\\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}\\). Then Lemma 2 yields \\(\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=\\{W\\}\\). Therefore \\(P+W\\) is a support plane of \\(\\Delta\\) such that they have only one common point so no line segment exists on \\(\\partial \\Delta\\) which would contain \\(W\\) in its interior.\n\nSince this case occurs for antipodal vertex pairs and each pair is counted twice, the number of such boundary points on \\(\\Delta\\) is \\(2 A\\).\n\nCase 2: Point \\(U\\) is an interior point of an edge \\(E_{i}\\) and \\(V\\) is a vertex of \\(\\Gamma\\). Choose plane \\(P\\) such that \\(\\Psi_{1}=E_{i}-U\\) and \\(\\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}\\). By Lemma 2, \\(\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=E_{i}-V\\). Hence there exists a line segment in \\(\\partial \\Delta\\) which contains \\(W\\) in its interior, but there is no planar region in \\(\\partial \\Delta\\) with the same property.\n\nWe obtain a similar result if \\(V\\) belongs to an edge of \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(U\\) is a vertex.\nCase 3: Points \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are interior points of edges \\(E_{i}\\) and \\(E_{j}\\), respectively. Let \\(P\\) be the plane of \\(E_{i}-U\\) and \\(E_{j}-V\\). Then \\(\\Psi_{1}=E_{i}-U, \\Psi_{2}=E_{j}-V\\) and \\(\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=E_{i}-E_{j}\\). Therefore point \\(W\\) belongs to a parallelogram face on \\(\\partial \\Delta\\).\n\nThe centre of the parallelogram is \\(Q_{i}-Q_{j}\\), the vector between the midpoints. Therefore an edge pair ( \\(E_{i}, E_{j}\\) ) occurs if and only if \\(Q_{i}\\) and \\(Q_{j}\\) are antipodal which happens \\(2 B\\) times.\n\nCase 4: Point \\(U\\) lies in the interior of a face \\(F_{i}\\) and \\(V\\) is a vertex of \\(\\Gamma\\). The only choice for \\(P\\) is the plane of \\(F_{i}-U\\). Then we have \\(\\Psi_{1}=F_{i}-U, \\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}\\) and \\(\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=F_{i}-V\\). This is a planar face of \\(\\partial \\Delta\\) which is congruent to \\(F_{i}\\).\n\nFor each face \\(F_{i}\\), the only possible vertex \\(V\\) is the farthest one from the plane of \\(F_{i}\\).\nIf \\(U\\) is a vertex and \\(V\\) belongs to face \\(F_{i}\\) then we obtain the same way that \\(W\\) belongs to a face \\(-F_{i}+U\\) which is also congruent to \\(F_{i}\\). Therefore, each face of \\(\\Gamma\\) has two copies on \\(\\partial \\Delta\\), a translated and a reflected copy.\n\nCase 5: Point \\(U\\) belongs to a face \\(F_{i}\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\) and point \\(V\\) belongs to an edge or a face \\(G\\). In this case objects \\(F_{i}\\) and \\(G\\) must be parallel which is not allowed.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_b870456914a15f8830dfg-34}\n\nNow all points in \\(\\partial \\Delta\\) belong to some planar polygons (cases 3 and 4), finitely many line segments (case 2) and points (case 1). Therefore \\(\\Delta\\) is indeed a polyhedron. Now compute the numbers of its vertices, edges and faces.\n\nThe vertices are obtained in case 1, their number is \\(2 A\\).\nFaces are obtained in cases 3 and 4. Case 3 generates \\(2 B\\) parallelogram faces. Case 4 generates \\(2 \\ell\\) faces.\n\nWe compute the number of edges of \\(\\Delta\\) from the degrees (number of sides) of faces of \\(\\Gamma\\). Let \\(d_{i}\\) be the the degree of face \\(F_{i}\\). The sum of degrees is twice as much as the number of edges, so \\(d_{1}+d_{2}+\\ldots+d_{l}=2 m\\). The sum of degrees of faces of \\(\\Delta\\) is \\(2 B \\cdot 4+2\\left(d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdots+d_{l}\\right)=8 B+4 m\\), so the number of edges on \\(\\Delta\\) is \\(4 B+2 m\\).\n\nApplying Euler's polyhedron theorem on \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\), we have \\(n+l=m+2\\) and \\(2 A+(2 B+2 \\ell)=\\) \\((4 B+2 m)+2\\). Then the conclusion follows:\n\n\\[\nA-B=m-\\ell+1=n-1 .\n\\]"}

Hence the point \\(A\\) is the image of \\(A_{4}\\) under rotation by \\(2 \\varphi\\) about \\(O\\), the centre of ( \\(A B C\\) ). The same rotation sends \\(B_{4}\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(C_{4}\\) to \\(C\\). Triangle \\(A B C\\) is the image of \\(A_{4} B_{4} C_{4}\\) in this map. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\angle\\left(A_{4} B_{4}, A B\\right)=\\angle\\left(B_{4} C_{4}, B C\\right)=\\angle\\left(C_{4} A_{4}, C A\\right)=2 \\varphi .\n\\]\n\nSince the rotation by \\(2 \\varphi\\) about \\(O\\) takes \\(B_{4}\\) to \\(B\\), we have \\(\\angle\\left(A B_{4}, A B\\right)=\\varphi\\).

This combined with \\(\\angle\\left(C_{5} C_{1}, C_{1} A\\right)=\\angle\\left(P C_{1}, A B\\right)=\\varphi\\) (see (2)) proves that the quadrilateral \\(A B_{4} C_{5} C_{1}\\) is an isosceles trapezoid with \\(A C_{1}=B_{4} C_{5}\\).\n\nInterchanging the roles of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) we infer that also \\(B C_{1}=A_{4} C_{5}\\). And since \\(A C_{1}+B C_{1}=\\) \\(A B=A_{4} B_{4}\\), it follows that the point \\(C_{5}\\) lies on the line segment \\(A_{4} B_{4}\\) and partitions it into segments \\(A_{4} C_{5}, B_{4} C_{5}\\) of lengths \\(B C_{1}\\left(=A C_{3}\\right)\\) and \\(A C_{1}\\left(=B C_{3}\\right)\\). In other words, the rotation which maps triangle \\(A_{4} B_{4} C_{4}\\) onto \\(A B C\\) carries \\(C_{5}\\) onto \\(C_{3}\\). Likewise, it sends \\(A_{5}\\) to \\(A_{3}\\) and \\(B_{5}\\) to \\(B_{3}\\). So the triangles \\(A_{3} B_{3} C_{3}\\) and \\(A_{5} B_{5} C_{5}\\) are congruent. It now suffices to show that the latter is similar to \\(A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}\\).\n\nLines \\(B_{4} C_{5}\\) and \\(P C_{5}\\) coincide respectively with \\(A_{4} B_{4}\\) and \\(P C_{1}\\). Thus by (4)\n\n\\[\n\\angle\\left(B_{4} C_{5}, P C_{5}\\right)=\\varphi\n\\]\n\nAnalogously (by cyclic shift) \\(\\varphi=\\angle\\left(C_{4} A_{5}, P A_{5}\\right)\\), which rewrites as\n\n\\[\n\\varphi=\\angle\\left(B_{4} A_{5}, P A_{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThese relations imply that the points \\(P, B_{4}, C_{5}, A_{5}\\) are concyclic. Analogously, \\(P, C_{4}, A_{5}, B_{5}\\) and \\(P, A_{4}, B_{5}, C_{5}\\) are concyclic quadruples. Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\angle\\left(A_{5} B_{5}, C_{5} B_{5}\\right)=\\angle\\left(A_{5} B_{5}, P B_{5}\\right)+\\angle\\left(P B_{5}, C_{5} B_{5}\\right)=\\angle\\left(A_{5} C_{4}, P C_{4}\\right)+\\angle\\left(P A_{4}, C_{5} A_{4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, since the points \\(A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}, A_{4}, B_{4}, C_{4}\\) all lie on the circle ( \\(A B C\\) ), we have\n\n\\[\n\\angle\\left(A_{2} B_{2}, C_{2} B_{2}\\right)=\\angle\\left(A_{2} B_{2}, B_{4} B_{2}\\right)+\\angle\\left(B_{4} B_{2}, C_{2} B_{2}\\right)=\\angle\\left(A_{2} A_{4}, B_{4} A_{4}\\right)+\\angle\\left(B_{4} C_{4}, C_{2} C_{4}\\right) .\n\\]\n\nBut the lines \\(A_{2} A_{4}, B_{4} A_{4}, B_{4} C_{4}, C_{2} C_{4}\\) coincide respectively with \\(P A_{4}, C_{5} A_{4}, A_{5} C_{4}, P C_{4}\\). So the sums on the right-hand sides of (5) and (6) are equal, leading to equality between their left-hand sides: \\(\\angle\\left(A_{5} B_{5}, C_{5} B_{5}\\right)=\\angle\\left(A_{2} B_{2}, C_{2} B_{2}\\right)\\). Hence (by cyclic shift, once more) also \\(\\angle\\left(B_{5} C_{5}, A_{5} C_{5}\\right)=\\angle\\left(B_{2} C_{2}, A_{2} C_{2}\\right)\\) and \\(\\angle\\left(C_{5} A_{5}, B_{5} A_{5}\\right)=\\angle\\left(C_{2} A_{2}, B_{2} A_{2}\\right)\\). This means that the triangles \\(A_{5} B_{5} C_{5}\\) and \\(A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}\\) have their corresponding angles equal, and consequently they are similar.\n\nComment 1. This is the way in which the proof has been presented by the proposer. Trying to work it out in the language of classical geometry, so as to avoid oriented angles, one is led to difficulties due to the fact that the reasoning becomes heavily case-dependent. Disposition of relevant points can vary in many respects. Angles which are equal in one case become supplementary in another. Although it seems not hard to translate all formulas from the shapes they have in one situation to the one they have in another, the real trouble is to identify all cases possible and rigorously verify that the key conclusions retain validity in each case.\n\nThe use of oriented angles is a very efficient method to omit this trouble. It seems to be the most appropriate environment in which the solution can be elaborated.\nComment 2. Actually, the fact that the circles \\(\\left(A B_{1} C_{1}\\right),\\left(B C_{1} A_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(C A_{1} B_{1}\\right)\\) have a common point does not require a proof; it is known as Miquel's theorem."}

Without loss of generality we may assume \\(x, y>0\\).\nThe numbers \\(c-a\\) and \\(c+b\\) can be written as\n\n\\[\nc-a=a(x-1)-b y \\quad \\text { and } \\quad c+b=a x-b(y-1)\n\\]\n\nand trivially \\(w(c-a) \\leq(x-1)+y<w(c)\\) and \\(w(c+b) \\leq x+(y-1)<w(c)\\) in all cases.\nNow assume that \\(c\\) is a local champion and consider \\(w(c+a)\\). Since \\(w(c+a) \\leq w(c)\\), there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that\n\n\\[\nc+a=a(x+1-k b)-b(y-k a) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad|x+1-k b|+|y-k a| \\leq x+y\n\\]\n\nThis inequality cannot hold if \\(k \\leq 0\\), therefore \\(k>0\\). We prove that we can choose \\(k=1\\).\n\nConsider the function \\(f(t)=|x+1-b t|+|y-a t|-(x+y)\\). This is a convex function and we have \\(f(0)=1\\) and \\(f(k) \\leq 0\\). By Jensen's inequality, \\(f(1) \\leq\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\right) f(0)+\\frac{1}{k} f(k)<1\\). But \\(f(1)\\) is an integer. Therefore \\(f(1) \\leq 0\\) and\n\n\\[\n|x+1-b|+|y-a| \\leq x+y\n\\]\n\nKnowing \\(c=a(x-b)-b(y-a)\\), we also have\n\n\\[\nx+y \\leq|x-b|+|y-a| .\n\\]\n\nCombining the two inequalities yields \\(|x+1-b| \\leq|x-b|\\) which is equivalent to \\(x<b\\).\nConsidering \\(w(c-b)\\), we obtain similarly that \\(y<a\\).\nNow \\(|x-b|=b-x,|x+1-b|=b-x-1\\) and \\(|y-a|=a-y\\), therefore we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(b-x-1)+(a-y) & \\leq x+y \\leq(b-x)+(a-y) \n\\frac{a+b-1}{2} & \\leq x+y \\leq \\frac{a+b}{2}\n\n\\]\n\nHence \\(x+y=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\).\nTo prove the opposite direction, assume \\(0<x<b\\) and \\(x+y=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\). Since \\(a>b\\), we also have \\(0<y<a\\). Then\n\n\\[\nw(c+a) \\leq|x+1-b|+|y-a|=a+b-1-(x+y) \\leq x+y=w(c)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nw(c-b) \\leq|x-b|+|y+1-a|=a+b-1-(x+y) \\leq x+y=w(c)\n\\]\n\ntherefore \\(c\\) is a local champion indeed.\nLemma 3. Let \\(c=a x-b y\\) and assume that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have the same sign, \\(|x|<b,|y|<a\\) and \\(|x|+|y|=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\). Then \\(w(c)=x+y\\).\nProof. By definition \\(w(c)=\\min \\{|x-k b|+|y-k a|: k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\). If \\(k \\leq 0\\) then obviously \\(|x-k b|+|y-k a| \\geq x+y\\). If \\(k \\geq 1\\) then\n\n\\[\n|x-k b|+|y-k a|=(k b-x)+(k a-y)=k(a+b)-(x+y) \\geq(2 k-1)(x+y) \\geq x+y .\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(w(c)=x+y\\) indeed.\nLemmas 1, 2 and 3 together yield that the set of local champions is\n\n\\[\nC=\\left\\{ \\pm(a x-b y): 0<x<b, x+y=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\right\\} .\n\\]\n\nDenote by \\(C^{+}\\)and \\(C^{-}\\)the two sets generated by the expressions \\(+(a x-b y)\\) and \\(-(a x-b y)\\), respectively. It is easy to see that both sets are arithmetic progressions of length \\(b-1\\), with difference \\(a+b\\).\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are odd, then \\(C^{+}=C^{-}\\), because \\(a(-x)-b(-y)=a(b-x)-b(a-y)\\) and \\(x+y=\\frac{a+b}{2}\\) is equivalent to \\((b-x)+(a-y)=\\frac{a+b}{2}\\). In this case there exist \\(b-1\\) local champions.\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have opposite parities then the answer is different. For any \\(c_{1} \\in C^{+}\\)and \\(c_{2} \\in C^{-}\\),\n\n\\[\n2 c_{1} \\equiv-2 c_{2} \\equiv 2\\left(a \\frac{a+b-1}{2}-b \\cdot 0\\right) \\equiv-a \\quad(\\bmod a+b)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n2 c_{1}-2 c_{2} \\equiv-2 a \\quad(\\bmod a+b)\n\\]\n\nThe number \\(a+b\\) is odd and relatively prime to \\(a\\), therefore the elements of \\(C^{+}\\)and \\(C^{-}\\)belong to two different residue classes modulo \\(a+b\\). Hence, the set \\(C\\) is the union of two disjoint arithmetic progressions and the number of all local champions is \\(2(b-1)\\).\n\nSo the number of local champions is \\(b-1\\) if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are odd and \\(2(b-1)\\) otherwise.\n\nComment. The original question, as stated by the proposer, was:\n(a) Show that there exists only finitely many local champions;\n(b) Show that there exists at least one local champion."}

Thus \\(k<a\\).\n\nLet \\(d=\\operatorname{gcd}(a, k)\\) and let \\(a^{\\prime}=a / d, k^{\\prime}=k / d\\). Since \\(0<k<a\\), we also have \\(0<d<a\\).

The \\(d\\) sequences contain \\(a^{\\prime} d=a\\) numbers altogether. We shall now prove that no two of these numbers are congruent modulo \\(a\\).\n\nSuppose that\n\n\\[\n2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+m k\\right) \\equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\\left(b_{j}+n k\\right) \\quad(\\bmod a)\n\\]\n\nfor some values of \\(i, j \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\}\\) and \\(m, n \\in\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, a^{\\prime}-1\\right\\}\\). Since \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(a\\), we also have\n\n\\[\n2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+m k\\right) \\equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\\left(b_{j}+n k\\right) \\quad(\\bmod d)\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(k\\) and in view of (1), we obtain \\(i \\equiv j(\\bmod d)\\).

For some \\(j \\leq m\\), it must have been the largest element of \\(X_{j}\\). Let \\(l\\) denote the least element in \\(X_{j}\\). Then \\(k+b=l+a+b\\), so \\(k=l+a\\).

Then the move leading to this stage must have been an \\(i\\)-switch, but it would be contrary to the condition that column \\(i\\) have at least 2 more pebbles than column \\(i+1\\), to allow switches.\n\nTo prove (b), if such a configuration were obtainable, there would be a minimum value of \\(j-i\\) over all such obtainable configurations, and we now show that there is no minimum. Suppose \\(p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots\\) was such a minimal configuration. It cannot be that \\(j=i+1\\), for what would columns \\(i, i+1, i+2\\) look like just before the move that made the heights equal?

Consider the first configuration \\(C\\) in the sequence for which columns \\(i, i+1, j, j+1\\) are at their final heights. Note that from \\(p_{i+1}\\) to \\(p_{j}\\) the columns decrease by exactly one each time in \\(C\\), because if there was a drop of 2 or more at some point, there would have to be another drop of 0 in this interval to obtain an average of 1 or less, and thus \\(j-i\\) is not minimal. The move leading to \\(C\\) was either an \\(i\\)-switch or a \\(j\\)-switch. If it was the former, at the previous stage columns \\(i+1\\) and \\(i+2\\) had the same height, violating the minimality of \\(j-i\\). A similar contradiction arises if the move was a \\(j\\)-switch.\n\nFinally, to prove (c), if any drop is 2 or more, the configuration isn't final. However, if all drops are 0 or 1 , and there were two drops of 0 between nonempty columns (say between \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\) and between \\(j\\) and \\(j+1\\) ), then (b) would be violated.

If \\(p\\) is a prime divisor of \\(z\\) and \\(u\\), then \\(p\\) is a divisor of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Thus we may assume, without loss of generality, that \\(z\\) and \\(u\\) are relatively prime.

By well known facts, this equation has infinitely many positive integer solutions \\(a-b\\) and \\(b\\), and both of these quantities can be made arbitrarily large.

The asymptotes of the hyperbola have slope 0 and 1 . One branch of the hyperbola lies in the half plane \\(X \\geq 1\\), the other in the half plane \\(X<1\\). Furthermore, the leftmost point on the branch in the half plane \\(X \\geq 1\\) has coordinates ( \\(3+2 \\sqrt{2}, 2+\\sqrt{2}\\) ). Thus, if ( \\(X, Z\\) ) is on the hyperbola and \\(X \\geq 1\\), then \\(X \\geq 3+2 \\sqrt{2}\\), and this bound cannot be improved.

In particular, let \\(r\\) be a rational number, \\(r \\neq 0\\) or 1 .

Finally, if \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) are positive rationals satisfying \\((*)\\), then we can find integers \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) with \\(X=x / y\\) and \\(Z=z / y\\). It is easy to check that \\(x, y, z\\), and \\(u=x+y-z\\) are positive integers that satisfy the equations in the problem statement. Thus if \\(x, y, z\\) and \\(u\\) are positive integers that satisfy the equations in the statement, and \\(x \\geq y\\), then \\(x / y>3+2 \\sqrt{2}\\).

For example, starting from \\(2^{m}\\) equal numbers on the sheets, in \\(2^{m-1}\\) consecutive steps we can double all numbers. After \\(m\\) such doubling rounds we have the number \\(2^{m}\\) on every sheet.\n\nComment 2. There are several versions of the solution above. E.g., one may try to assign to each positive integer \\(n\\) a weight \\(w_{n}\\) in such a way that the sum of the weights of the numbers written on the sheets increases, say, by at least 2 in each step. For this purpose, one needs the inequality\n\n\\[\n2 w_{a+b} \\geqslant w_{a}+w_{b}+2\n\\]\n\nto be satisfied for all positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nStarting from \\(w_{1}=1\\) and trying to choose the weights as small as possible, one may find that these weights can be defined as follows: For every positive integer \\(n\\), one chooses \\(k\\) to be the maximal integer such that \\(n \\geqslant 2^{k}\\), and puts\n\n\\[\nw_{n}=k+\\frac{n}{2^{k}}=\\min _{d \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\geqslant 0}\\left(d+\\frac{n}{2^{d}}\\right) .\n\\]\n\nNow, in order to prove that these weights satisfy (1), one may take arbitrary positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and choose an integer \\(d \\geqslant 0\\) such that \\(w_{a+b}=d+\\frac{a+b}{2^{d}}\\). Then one has\n\n\\[\n2 w_{a+b}=2 d+2 \\cdot \\frac{a+b}{2^{d}}=\\left((d-1)+\\frac{a}{2^{d-1}}\\right)+\\left((d-1)+\\frac{b}{2^{d-1}}\\right)+2 \\geqslant w_{a}+w_{b}+2 .\n\\]\n\nSince the initial sum of the weights was \\(2^{m}\\), after \\(m 2^{m-1}\\) steps the sum is at least \\((m+1) 2^{m}\\).

An intuitive strategy to minimise the sum of numbers is that in every step we choose the two smallest numbers. We may call this the greedy strategy. In the following paragraphs we prove that the greedy strategy indeed provides the least possible sum of numbers.\n\nClaim. Starting from any sequence \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\) of positive real numbers on \\(N\\) sheets, for any number \\(k\\) of steps, the greedy strategy achieves the lowest possible sum of numbers.\n\nProof. We apply induction on \\(k\\); for \\(k=1\\) the statement is obvious. Let \\(k \\geqslant 2\\), and assume that the claim is true for smaller values.\n\nEvery sequence of \\(k\\) steps can be encoded as \\(S=\\left(\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{k}, j_{k}\\right)\\right)\\), where, for \\(r=1,2, \\ldots, k\\), the numbers \\(i_{r}\\) and \\(j_{r}\\) are the indices of the two sheets that are chosen in the \\(r^{\\text {th }}\\) step. The resulting final sum will be some linear combination of \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\), say, \\(c_{1} x_{1}+\\cdots+c_{N} x_{N}\\) with positive integers \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{N}\\) that depend on \\(S\\) only. Call the numbers \\(\\left(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{N}\\right)\\) the characteristic vector of \\(S\\).\n\nChoose a sequence \\(S_{0}=\\left(\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{k}, j_{k}\\right)\\right)\\) of steps that produces the minimal sum, starting from \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\), and let \\(\\left(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{N}\\right)\\) be the characteristic vector of \\(S\\). We may assume that the sheets are indexed in such an order that \\(c_{1} \\geqslant c_{2} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant c_{N}\\). If the sheets (and the numbers) are permuted by a permutation \\(\\pi\\) of the indices \\((1,2, \\ldots, N)\\) and then the same steps are performed, we can obtain the sum \\(\\sum_{t=1}^{N} c_{t} x_{\\pi(t)}\\). By the rearrangement inequality, the smallest possible sum can be achieved when the numbers \\(\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right)\\) are in non-decreasing order. So we can assume that also \\(x_{1} \\leqslant x_{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant x_{N}\\).\n\nLet \\(\\ell\\) be the largest index with \\(c_{1}=\\cdots=c_{\\ell}\\), and let the \\(r^{\\text {th }}\\) step be the first step for which \\(c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}\\) or \\(c_{j_{r}}=c_{1}\\). The role of \\(i_{r}\\) and \\(j_{r}\\) is symmetrical, so we can assume \\(c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}\\) and thus \\(i_{r} \\leqslant \\ell\\). We show that \\(c_{j_{r}}=c_{1}\\) and \\(j_{r} \\leqslant \\ell\\) hold, too.\n\nBefore the \\(r^{\\text {th }}\\) step, on the \\(i_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}\\) sheet we had the number \\(x_{i_{r}}\\). On the \\(j_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}\\) sheet there was a linear combination that contains the number \\(x_{j_{r}}\\) with a positive integer coefficient, and possibly some other terms. In the \\(r^{\\text {th }}\\) step, the number \\(x_{i_{r}}\\) joins that linear combination. From this point, each sheet contains a linear combination of \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\), with the coefficient of \\(x_{j_{r}}\\) being not smaller than the coefficient of \\(x_{i_{r}}\\). This is preserved to the end of the procedure, so we have \\(c_{j_{r}} \\geqslant c_{i_{r}}\\). But \\(c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}\\) is maximal among the coefficients, so we have \\(c_{j_{r}}=c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}\\) and thus \\(j_{r} \\leqslant \\ell\\).\n\nEither from \\(c_{j_{r}}=c_{i_{r}}=c_{1}\\) or from the arguments in the previous paragraph we can see that none of the \\(i_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}\\) and the \\(j_{r}{ }^{\\text {th }}\\) sheets were used before step \\(r\\). Therefore, the final linear combination of the numbers does not change if the step \\(\\left(i_{r}, j_{r}\\right)\\) is performed first: the sequence of steps\n\n\\[\nS_{1}=\\left(\\left(i_{r}, j_{r}\\right),\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{r-1}, j_{r-1}\\right),\\left(i_{r+1}, j_{r+1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(i_{N}, j_{N}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\nalso produces the same minimal sum at the end. Therefore, we can replace \\(S_{0}\\) by \\(S_{1}\\) and we may assume that \\(r=1\\) and \\(c_{i_{1}}=c_{j_{1}}=c_{1}\\).\n\nAs \\(i_{1} \\neq j_{1}\\), we can see that \\(\\ell \\geqslant 2\\) and \\(c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{i_{1}}=c_{j_{1}}\\). Let \\(\\pi\\) be such a permutation of the indices \\((1,2, \\ldots, N)\\) that exchanges 1,2 with \\(i_{r}, j_{r}\\) and does not change the remaining indices. Let\n\n\\[\nS_{2}=\\left(\\left(\\pi\\left(i_{1}\\right), \\pi\\left(j_{1}\\right)\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\pi\\left(i_{N}\\right), \\pi\\left(j_{N}\\right)\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(c_{\\pi(i)}=c_{i}\\) for all indices \\(i\\), this sequence of steps produces the same, minimal sum. Moreover, in the first step we chose \\(x_{\\pi\\left(i_{1}\\right)}=x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{\\pi\\left(j_{1}\\right)}=x_{2}\\), the two smallest numbers.\n\nHence, it is possible to achieve the optimal sum if we follow the greedy strategy in the first step. By the induction hypothesis, following the greedy strategy in the remaining steps we achieve the optimal sum."}

By the maximality of \\(B\\), there exists at least one region \\(A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) whose only red side lies on \\(\\ell\\). Since \\(A\\) has at least three sides, it must have at least one blue vertex. Let us take one such vertex and associate it to \\(\\ell\\).\n\nSince each blue point belongs to four regions (some of which may be unbounded), it is associated to at most four red lines. Thus the total number of red lines is at most \\(4\\binom{k}{2}\\). On the other hand, this number is \\(n-k\\), so\n\n\\[\nn-k \\leqslant 2 k(k-1), \\quad \\text { thus } \\quad n \\leqslant 2 k^{2}-k \\leqslant 2 k^{2},\n\\]\n\nand finally \\(k \\geqslant\\lceil\\sqrt{n / 2}\\rceil\\), which gives the desired result.\nComment 1. The constant factor in the estimate can be improved in different ways; we sketch two of them below. On the other hand, the Problem Selection Committee is not aware of any results showing that it is sometimes impossible to colour \\(k\\) lines satisfying the desired condition for \\(k \\gg \\sqrt{n}\\). In this situation we find it more suitable to keep the original formulation of the problem.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Firstly, we show that in the proof above one has in fact \\(k=|B| \\geqslant\\lceil\\sqrt{2 n / 3}\\rceil\\).\n\n\nLet us make weighted associations as follows. Let a region \\(A\\) whose only red side lies on \\(\\ell\\) have \\(k\\) vertices, so that \\(k-2\\) of them are blue. We associate each of these blue vertices to \\(\\ell\\), and put the weight \\(\\frac{1}{k-2}\\) on each such association. So the sum of the weights of all the associations is exactly \\(n-k\\).\n\nNow, one may check that among the four regions adjacent to a blue vertex \\(v\\), at most two are triangles. This means that the sum of the weights of all associations involving \\(v\\) is at most \\(1+1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=3\\). This leads to the estimate\n\n\\[\nn-k \\leqslant 3\\binom{k}{2}\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n2 n \\leqslant 3 k^{2}-k<3 k^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhich yields \\(k \\geqslant\\lceil\\sqrt{2 n / 3}\\rceil\\).\n2. Next, we even show that \\(k=|B| \\geqslant\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil\\). For this, we specify the process of associating points to red lines in one more different way.\n\nCall a point red if it lies on a red line as well as on a blue line. Consider any red line \\(\\ell\\), and take an arbitrary region \\(A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) whose only red side lies on \\(\\ell\\). Let \\(r^{\\prime}, r, b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\) be its vertices in clockwise order with \\(r^{\\prime}, r \\in \\ell\\); then the points \\(r^{\\prime}, r\\) are red, while all the points \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\) are blue. Let us associate to \\(\\ell\\) the red point \\(r\\) and the blue point \\(b_{1}\\). One may notice that to each pair of a red point \\(r\\) and a blue point \\(b\\), at most one red line can be associated, since there is at most one region \\(A\\) having \\(r\\) and \\(b\\) as two clockwise consecutive vertices.\n\nWe claim now that at most two red lines are associated to each blue point \\(b\\); this leads to the desired bound\n\n\\[\nn-k \\leqslant 2\\binom{k}{2} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad n \\leqslant k^{2}\n\\]\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that three red lines \\(\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}\\), and \\(\\ell_{3}\\) are associated to the same blue point \\(b\\). Let \\(r_{1}, r_{2}\\), and \\(r_{3}\\) respectively be the red points associated to these lines; all these points are distinct. The point \\(b\\) defines four blue rays, and each point \\(r_{i}\\) is the red point closest to \\(b\\) on one of these rays. So we may assume that the points \\(r_{2}\\) and \\(r_{3}\\) lie on one blue line passing through \\(b\\), while \\(r_{1}\\) lies on the other one.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-36}\n\nNow consider the region \\(A\\) used to associate \\(r_{1}\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(\\ell_{1}\\). Three of its clockwise consecutive vertices are \\(r_{1}, b\\), and either \\(r_{2}\\) or \\(r_{3}\\) (say, \\(r_{2}\\) ). Since \\(A\\) has only one red side, it can only be the triangle \\(r_{1} b r_{2}\\); but then both \\(\\ell_{1}\\) and \\(\\ell_{2}\\) pass through \\(r_{2}\\), as well as some blue line. This is impossible by the problem assumptions.\n\nComment 2.

Another possible approach to Part II of this problem is induction on \\(n\\). For \\(n=1\\), there is trivially only one rule in view of the second condition.\n\nIn the following, we assume that our claim (namely, that there are no possible rules other than those given in Part I) holds for \\(n-1\\) in place of \\(n\\). We start with the following observation: Claim. At least one of the two relations\n\n\\[\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})\n\\]\n\nholds.\nProof. Suppose that the first relation does not hold. Since our rule may only depend on the relative order, we must also have\n\n\\[\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\})\n\\]\n\nLikewise, if the second relation does not hold, then we must also have\n\n\\[\n(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\})\n\\]\n\nNow condition 3 implies that\n\n\\[\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\})\n\\]\n\nwhich contradicts the second condition.\nNow we distinguish two cases, depending on which of the two relations actually holds:\nFirst case: \\((\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})\\).\nLet \\(A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}\\) and \\(B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\) be two disjoint sets, both in increasing order. We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of \\(a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\) and \\(b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\), while \\(a_{1}\\) and \\(b_{1}\\) are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that \\(a_{2}<b_{2}\\). Then the relative order of \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\) is fixed, and the position of \\(b_{1}\\) has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value \\(b_{1}=x, B\\) wins, while for some other value \\(b_{1}=y, A\\) wins.\n\nWrite \\(B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\) and \\(B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\), and let \\(\\varepsilon>0\\) be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in \\(B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A\\). For any set \\(M\\), let \\(M \\pm \\varepsilon\\) be the set obtained by adding/subtracting \\(\\varepsilon\\) to all elements of \\(M\\). By our choice of \\(\\varepsilon\\), the relative order of the elements of \\(\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A\\) is still the same as for \\(B_{y} \\cup A\\), while the relative order of the elements of \\(\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A\\) is still the same as for \\(B_{x} \\cup A\\). Thus \\(A \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\), but \\(A \\succ B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\). Moreover, if \\(y>x\\), then \\(B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\) by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\nthe elements in \\(\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)\\) is the same as for the two sets \\(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}\\) and \\(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}\\), so that \\(B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\). In either case, we obtain\n\n\\[\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon \\prec A\n\\]\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3.\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on \\(a_{1}, b_{1}\\). Therefore, we can define a new rule \\(<^{*}\\) on sets of cardinality \\(n-1\\) by saying that \\(A<^{*} B\\) if and only if \\(A \\cup\\{a\\}<B \\cup\\{b\\}\\) for some \\(a, b\\) (or equivalently, all \\(a, b\\) ) such that \\(a<\\min A, b<\\min B\\) and \\(A \\cup\\{a\\}\\) and \\(B \\cup\\{b\\}\\) are disjoint. The rule \\(<^{*}\\) satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index \\(i\\) such that \\(A<{ }^{*} B\\) if and only if the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) smallest element of \\(A\\) is less than the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) smallest element of \\(B\\). This implies that \\(C<D\\) if and only if the \\((i+1)^{\\text {th }}\\) smallest element of \\(C\\) is less than the \\((i+1)^{\\text {th }}\\) smallest element of \\(D\\), which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: \\((\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})\\).\nSet \\(-A=\\{-a \\mid a \\in A\\}\\) for any \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). For any two disjoint sets \\(A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) of cardinality \\(n\\), we write \\(A<^{\\circ} B\\) to mean \\((-B)<(-A)\\). It is easy to see that \\(<^{\\circ}\\) defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some \\(i, A<^{\\circ} B\\) if and only if the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) smallest element of \\(A\\) is less than the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) smallest element of \\(B\\), which is equivalent to the condition that the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) largest element of \\(-A\\) is greater than the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) largest element of \\(-B\\). This proves that the original rule \\(<\\) also has the desired form.\n\nComment. The problem asks for all possible partial orders on the set of \\(n\\)-element subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) such that any two disjoint sets are comparable, the order relation only depends on the relative order of the elements, and \\(\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}<\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\) whenever \\(a_{i}<b_{i}\\) for all \\(i\\).\n\nAs the proposer points out, one may also ask for all total orders on all \\(n\\)-element subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) (dropping the condition of disjointness and requiring that \\(\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\} \\leq\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\) whenever \\(a_{i} \\leqslant b_{i}\\) for all \\(i\\) ). It turns out that the number of possibilities in this case is \\(n!\\), and all possible total orders are obtained in the following way. Fix a permutation \\(\\sigma \\in S_{n}\\). Let \\(A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}\\) and \\(B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\) be two subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}\\) and \\(b_{1}<b_{2}<\\cdots<b_{n}\\). Then we say that \\(A \\succ_{\\sigma} B\\) if and only if ( \\(a_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, a_{\\sigma(n)}\\) ) is lexicographically greater than ( \\(b_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, b_{\\sigma(n)}\\) ).\n\nIt seems, however, that this formulation adds rather more technicalities to the problem than additional ideas.\n\nThis page is intentionally left blank"}

Now each time one performs such a step, the total length of the segments that are present decreases due to the triangle inequality. So, as there are only finitely many possibilities for the set of segments present, the process must end at some stage.\n\nIn the above proposal, however, considering the sum of the Euclidean lengths of the segment that are present does not seem to help much, for even though it shows that the process must necessarily terminate after some finite number of steps, it does not seem to easily yield any upper bound on the number of these steps that grows polynomially with \\(n\\).\n\nOne may regard the concept of the value of a segment introduced in the above solution as an appropriately discretised version of Euclidean length suitable for obtaining such a bound.\n\nThe Problem Selection Committee still believes the problem to be sufficiently original for the competition.\n\nComment 2.

Then the sets \\(X_{i}\\) are exactly all the sets not containing \\(b\\), therefore each digit \\(a \\neq b\\) is written on exactly 256 of these cards, so \\(X_{1} \\triangle X_{2} \\triangle \\cdots \\triangle X_{512}=\\varnothing\\). Now, if we replace some summands in this sum by the other elements from their pairs, we will simply add \\(B\\) several times to this sum, thus the sum will either remain unchanged or change by \\(B\\), as required.\n\nNow we consider two cases.\nCase 1. Assume that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes the card \\(\\varnothing\\) on his first move. In this case, we present a winning strategy for \\(\\mathcal{S}\\).\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) take an arbitrary card \\(A\\). Assume that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes card \\(B\\) after that; then \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes \\(A \\triangle B\\). Split all 1024 cards into 512 pairs of the form ( \\(X, X \\triangle B\\) ); we call two cards in one pair partners. Then the four cards taken so far form two pairs ( \\(\\varnothing, B\\) ) and ( \\(A, A \\triangle B\\) ) belonging to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), respectively. On each of the subsequent moves, when \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes some card, \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) should take the partner of this card in response.\n\nConsider the situation at the end of the game. Let us for a moment replace card \\(A\\) belonging to \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) by \\(\\varnothing\\). Then he would have one card from each pair; by our lemma, the sum of all these cards would be either \\(\\varnothing\\) or \\(B\\). Now, replacing \\(\\varnothing\\) back by \\(A\\) we get that the actual sum of the cards of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is either \\(A\\) or \\(A \\triangle B\\), and he has both these cards. Thus \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) wins.\n\nCase 2. Now assume that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes some card \\(A \\neq \\varnothing\\) on his first move. Let us present a winning strategy for \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) in this case.\n\nAssume that \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes some card \\(B \\neq \\varnothing\\) on his first move; then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes \\(A \\triangle B\\). Again, let us split all the cards into pairs of the form ( \\(X, X \\triangle B\\) ); then the cards which have not been taken yet form several complete pairs and one extra element (card \\(\\varnothing\\) has not been taken while its partner \\(B\\) has). Now, on each of the subsequent moves, if \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes some element from a\ncomplete pair, then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes its partner. If \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes the extra element, then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes an arbitrary card \\(Y\\), and the partner of \\(Y\\) becomes the new extra element.\n\nThus, on his last move \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is forced to take the extra element. After that player \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has cards \\(A\\) and \\(A \\triangle B\\), player \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) has cards \\(B\\) and \\(\\varnothing\\), and \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has exactly one element from every other pair. Thus the situation is the same as in the previous case with roles reversed, and \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) wins.\n\nFinally, if \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes \\(\\varnothing\\) on his first move then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) denotes any card which has not been taken yet by \\(B\\) and takes \\(A \\triangle B\\). After that, the same strategy as above is applicable.\n\nComment 1. If one wants to avoid the unusual question about the first move, one may change the formulation as follows. (The difficulty of the problem would decrease somewhat.)\n\nA card deck consists of 1023 cards; on each card, a nonempty set of distinct decimal digits is written in such a way that no two of these sets coincide. Two players alternately take cards from the deck, one card per turn. When the deck is empty, each player checks if he can throw out one of his cards so that for each of the ten digits, he still holds an even number of cards with this digit. If one player can do this but the other one cannot, the one who can is the winner; otherwise a draw is declared.\n\nDetermine which of the players (if any) has a winning strategy.\nThe winner in this version is the first player. The analysis of the game from the first two paragraphs of the previous solution applies to this version as well, except for the case \\(C=\\varnothing\\) in which the result is a draw. Then the strategy for \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in Case 1 works for \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) in this version: the sum of all his cards at the end is either \\(A\\) or \\(A \\triangle B\\), thus nonempty in both cases.\n\nComment 2. Notice that all the cards form a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{F}_{2}\\), with \\(\\triangle\\) the operation of addition. Due to the automorphisms of this space, all possibilities for \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) 's first move except \\(\\varnothing\\) are equivalent. The same holds for the response by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) if \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes the card \\(\\varnothing\\) on his first move.\n\nComment 3. It is not that hard to show that in the initial game, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has a winning move, by the idea of \"strategy stealing\".\n\nNamely, assume that \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) has a winning strategy. Let us take two card decks and start two games, in which \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) will act by his strategy. In the first game, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes an arbitrary card \\(A_{1}\\); assume that \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes some \\(B_{1}\\) in response. Then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes the card \\(B_{1}\\) at the second game; let the response by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be \\(A_{2}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes \\(A_{2}\\) in the first game and gets a response \\(B_{2}\\), and so on.\n\nThis process stops at some moment when in the second game \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) takes \\(A_{i}=A_{1}\\). At this moment the players hold the same sets of cards in both games, but with roles reversed. Now, if some cards remain in the decks, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes an arbitrary card from the first deck starting a similar cycle.\n\nAt the end of the game, player \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) 's cards in the first game are exactly player \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) 's cards in the second game, and vice versa. Thus in one of the games \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) will win, which is impossible by our assumption.\n\nOne may notice that the strategy in Case 2 is constructed exactly in this way from the strategy in Case 1. This is possible since every response by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) wins if \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) takes the card \\(\\varnothing\\) on his first move."}

Turbo always keeps sliding along the current circle until he reaches an intersection with another circle. Then he continues his journey on this new circle and also changes the direction of moving, i.e. from clockwise to anticlockwise or vice versa.\n\nSuppose that Turbo's path entirely covers all circles. Prove that \\(n\\) must be odd.\n(India)", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2014, "solution": "Replace every cross (i.e. intersection of two circles) by two small circle arcs that indicate the direction in which the snail should leave the cross (see Figure 1.1). Notice that the placement of the small arcs does not depend on the direction of moving on the curves; no matter which direction the snail is moving on the circle arcs, he will follow the same curves (see Figure 1.2). In this way we have a set of curves, that are the possible paths of the snail. Call these curves snail orbits or just orbits. Every snail orbit is a simple closed curve that has no intersection with any other orbit.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-45}\n\nFigure 1.1\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-45(1)}\n\nFigure 1.2\n\nWe prove the following, more general statement.\n(*) In any configuration of \\(n\\) circles such that no two of them are tangent, the number of snail orbits has the same parity as the number \\(n\\). (Note that it is not assumed that all circle pairs intersect.)\n\nThis immediately solves the problem.\nLet us introduce the following operation that will be called flipping a cross. At a cross, remove the two small arcs of the orbits, and replace them by the other two arcs. Hence, when the snail arrives at a flipped cross, he will continue on the other circle as before, but he will preserve the orientation in which he goes along the circle arcs (see Figure 2).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-45(2)}\n\nFigure 2\nConsider what happens to the number of orbits when a cross is flipped. Denote by \\(a, b, c\\), and \\(d\\) the four arcs that meet at the cross such that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to the same circle. Before the flipping \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) were connected to \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), respectively, and after the flipping \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are connected to \\(d\\) and \\(c\\), respectively.\n\nThe orbits passing through the cross are closed curves, so each of the arcs \\(a, b, c\\), and \\(d\\) is connected to another one by orbits outside the cross. We distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1: \\(a\\) is connected to \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) is connected to \\(d\\) by the orbits outside the cross (see Figure 3.1).\n\nWe show that this case is impossible. Remove the two small arcs at the cross, connect \\(a\\) to \\(b\\), and connect \\(c\\) to \\(d\\) at the cross. Let \\(\\gamma\\) be the new closed curve containing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and let \\(\\delta\\) be the new curve that connects \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). These two curves intersect at the cross. So one of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) is inside \\(\\gamma\\) and the other one is outside \\(\\gamma\\). Then the two closed curves have to meet at least one more time, but this is a contradiction, since no orbit can intersect itself.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-46(2)}\n\nFigure 3.1\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-46(4)}\n\nFigure 3.2\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-46(1)}\n\nFigure 3.3\n\nCase 2: \\(a\\) is connected to \\(c\\) and \\(b\\) is connected to \\(d\\) (see Figure 3.2).\nBefore the flipping \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) belong to one orbit and \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) belong to another orbit. Flipping the cross merges the two orbits into a single orbit. Hence, the number of orbits decreases by 1 .\n\nCase 3: \\(a\\) is connected to \\(d\\) and \\(b\\) is connected to \\(c\\) (see Figure 3.3).\nBefore the flipping the arcs \\(a, b, c\\), and \\(d\\) belong to a single orbit. Flipping the cross splits that orbit in two. The number of orbits increases by 1 .\n\nAs can be seen, every flipping decreases or increases the number of orbits by one, thus changes its parity.\n\nNow flip every cross, one by one. Since every pair of circles has 0 or 2 intersections, the number of crosses is even. Therefore, when all crosses have been flipped, the original parity of the number of orbits is restored. So it is sufficient to prove (*) for the new configuration, where all crosses are flipped. Of course also in this new configuration the (modified) orbits are simple closed curves not intersecting each other.\n\nOrient the orbits in such a way that the snail always moves anticlockwise along the circle arcs. Figure 4 shows the same circles as in Figure 1 after flipping all crosses and adding orientation. (Note that this orientation may be different from the orientation of the orbit as a planar curve; the orientation of every orbit may be negative as well as positive, like the middle orbit in Figure 4.) If the snail moves around an orbit, the total angle change in his moving direction, the total curvature, is either \\(+2 \\pi\\) or \\(-2 \\pi\\), depending on the orientation of the orbit. Let \\(P\\) and \\(N\\) be the number of orbits with positive and negative orientation, respectively. Then the total curvature of all orbits is \\((P-N) \\cdot 2 \\pi\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-46}\n\nFigure 4\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-46(3)}\n\nFigure 5\n\nDouble-count the total curvature of all orbits. Along every circle the total curvature is \\(2 \\pi\\). At every cross, the two turnings make two changes with some angles having the same absolute value but opposite signs, as depicted in Figure 5. So the changes in the direction at the crosses cancel out. Hence, the total curvature is \\(n \\cdot 2 \\pi\\).\n\nNow we have \\((P-N) \\cdot 2 \\pi=n \\cdot 2 \\pi\\), so \\(P-N=n\\). The number of (modified) orbits is \\(P+N\\), that has a same parity as \\(P-N=n\\).\n\nSolution 2. We present a different proof of (*).\nWe perform a sequence of small modification steps on the configuration of the circles in such a way that at the end they have no intersection at all (see Figure 6.1). We use two kinds of local changes to the structure of the orbits (see Figure 6.2):\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Type-1 step: An arc of a circle is moved over an arc of another circle; such a step creates or removes two intersections.\n  \\item Type-2 step: An arc of a circle is moved through the intersection of two other circles.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-47(1)}\n\n\nFigure 6.1\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-47}\n\nFigure 6.2\n\nWe assume that in every step only one circle is moved, and that this circle is moved over at most one arc or intersection point of other circles.\n\nWe will show that the parity of the number of orbits does not change in any step. As every circle becomes a separate orbit at the end of the procedure, this fact proves (*).\n\nConsider what happens to the number of orbits when a Type-1 step is performed. The two intersection points are created or removed in a small neighbourhood. Denote some points of the two circles where they enter or leave this neighbourhood by \\(a, b, c\\), and \\(d\\) in this order around the neighbourhood; let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to one circle and let \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) belong to the other circle. The two circle arcs may have the same or opposite orientations. Moreover, the four end-points of the two arcs are connected by the other parts of the orbits. This can happen in two ways without intersection: either \\(a\\) is connected to \\(d\\) and \\(b\\) is connected to \\(c\\), or \\(a\\) is connected to \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) is connected to \\(d\\). Altogether we have four cases, as shown in Figure 7.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-47(2)}\n\nFigure 7\nWe can see that the number of orbits is changed by -2 or +2 in the leftmost case when the arcs have the same orientation, \\(a\\) is connected to \\(d\\), and \\(b\\) is connected to \\(c\\). In the other three cases the number of orbits is not changed. Hence, Type-1 steps do not change the parity of the number of orbits.\n\nNow consider a Type-2 step. The three circles enclose a small, triangular region; by the step, this triangle is replaced by another triangle. Again, the modification of the orbits is done in some small neighbourhood; the structure does not change outside. Each side of the triangle shaped region can be convex or concave; the number of concave sides can be \\(0,1,2\\) or 3 , so there are 4 possible arrangements of the orbits inside the neighbourhood, as shown in Figure 8.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-48(1)}\n\nFigure 8\nDenote the points where the three circles enter or leave the neighbourhood by \\(a, b, c, d\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\) in this order around the neighbourhood. As can be seen in Figure 8, there are only two essentially different cases; either \\(a, c, e\\) are connected to \\(b, d, f\\), respectively, or \\(a, c, e\\) are connected to \\(f, b, d\\), respectively. The step either preserves the set of connections or switches to the other arrangement. Obviously, in the earlier case the number of orbits is not changed; therefore we have to consider only the latter case.\n\nThe points \\(a, b, c, d, e\\), and \\(f\\) are connected by the orbits outside, without intersection. If \\(a\\) was connected to \\(c\\), say, then this orbit would isolate \\(b\\), so this is impossible. Hence, each of \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) and \\(f\\) must be connected either to one of its neighbours or to the opposite point. If say \\(a\\) is connected to \\(d\\), then this orbit separates \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) from \\(e\\) and \\(f\\), therefore \\(b\\) must be connected to \\(c\\) and \\(e\\) must be connected to \\(f\\). Altogether there are only two cases and their reverses: either each point is connected to one of its neighbours or two opposite points are connected and the the remaining neigh boring pairs are connected to each other. See Figure 9.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-48}\n\nFigure 9\nWe can see that if only neighbouring points are connected, then the number of orbits is changed by +2 or -2 . If two opposite points are connected ( \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) in the figure), then the orbits are re-arranged, but their number is unchanged. Hence, Type-2 steps also preserve the parity. This completes the proof of (*).\n\nSolution 3. Like in the previous solutions, we do not need all circle pairs to intersect but we assume that the circles form a connected set. Denote by \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) the sets of circles and their intersection points, respectively.\n\nThe circles divide the plane into several simply connected, bounded regions and one unbounded region. Denote the set of these regions by \\(\\mathcal{R}\\). We say that an intersection point or a region is odd or even if it is contained inside an odd or even number of circles, respectively. Let \\(\\mathcal{P}_{\\text {odd }}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\text {odd }}\\) be the sets of odd intersection points and odd regions, respectively.\n\nClaim.\n\n\\[\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{\\text {odd }}\\right|-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{\\text {odd }}\\right| \\equiv n \\quad(\\bmod 2)\n\\]\n\nProof. For each circle \\(c \\in \\mathcal{C}\\), denote by \\(R_{c}, P_{c}\\), and \\(X_{c}\\) the number of regions inside \\(c\\), the number of intersection points inside \\(c\\), and the number of circles intersecting \\(c\\), respectively. The circles divide each other into several arcs; denote by \\(A_{c}\\) the number of such arcs inside \\(c\\). By double counting the regions and intersection points inside the circles we get\n\n\\[\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{odd}}\\right| \\equiv \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} R_{c} \\quad(\\bmod 2) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{odd}}\\right| \\equiv \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} P_{c} \\quad(\\bmod 2)\n\\]\n\nFor each circle \\(c\\), apply Euler's polyhedron theorem to the (simply connected) regions in \\(c\\). There are \\(2 X_{c}\\) intersection points on \\(c\\); they divide the circle into \\(2 X_{c}\\) arcs. The polyhedron theorem yields \\(\\left(R_{c}+1\\right)+\\left(P_{c}+2 X_{c}\\right)=\\left(A_{c}+2 X_{c}\\right)+2\\), considering the exterior of \\(c\\) as a single region. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nR_{c}+P_{c}=A_{c}+1 .\n\\]\n\nMoreover, we have four arcs starting from every interior points inside \\(c\\) and a single arc starting into the interior from each intersection point on the circle. By double-counting the end-points of the interior arcs we get \\(2 A_{c}=4 P_{c}+2 X_{c}\\), so\n\n\\[\nA_{c}=2 P_{c}+X_{c} .\n\\]\n\nThe relations (2) and (3) together yield\n\n\\[\nR_{c}-P_{c}=X_{c}+1 .\n\\]\n\nBy summing up (4) for all circles we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} R_{c}-\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} P_{c}=\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c}+|\\mathcal{C}|,\n\\]\n\nwhich yields\n\n\\[\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{\\text {odd }}\\right|-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{\\text {odd }}\\right| \\equiv \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c}+n \\quad(\\bmod 2) .\n\\]\n\nNotice that in \\(\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c}\\) each intersecting circle pair is counted twice, i.e., for both circles in the pair, so\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2),\n\\]\n\nwhich finishes the proof of the Claim.\nNow insert the same small arcs at the intersections as in the first solution, and suppose that there is a single snail orbit \\(b\\).\n\nFirst we show that the odd regions are inside the curve \\(b\\), while the even regions are outside. Take a region \\(r \\in \\mathcal{R}\\) and a point \\(x\\) in its interior, and draw a ray \\(y\\), starting from \\(x\\), that does not pass through any intersection point of the circles and is neither tangent to any of the circles. As is well-known, \\(x\\) is inside the curve \\(b\\) if and only if \\(y\\) intersects \\(b\\) an odd number of times (see Figure 10). Notice that if an arbitrary circle \\(c\\) contains \\(x\\) in its interior, then \\(c\\) intersects \\(y\\) at a single point; otherwise, if \\(x\\) is outside \\(c\\), then \\(c\\) has 2 or 0 intersections with \\(y\\). Therefore, \\(y\\) intersects \\(b\\) an odd number of times if and only if \\(x\\) is contained in an odd number of circles, so if and only if \\(r\\) is odd.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-49}\n\nFigure 10\nNow consider an intersection point \\(p\\) of two circles \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) and a small neighbourhood around \\(p\\). Suppose that \\(p\\) is contained inside \\(k\\) circles.\n\nWe have four regions that meet at \\(p\\). Let \\(r_{1}\\) be the region that lies outside both \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\), let \\(r_{2}\\) be the region that lies inside both \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\), and let \\(r_{3}\\) and \\(r_{4}\\) be the two remaining regions, each lying inside exactly one of \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\). The region \\(r_{1}\\) is contained inside the same \\(k\\) circles as \\(p\\); the region \\(r_{2}\\) is contained also by \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\), so by \\(k+2\\) circles in total; each of the regions \\(r_{3}\\) and \\(r_{4}\\) is contained inside \\(k+1\\) circles. After the small arcs have been inserted at \\(p\\), the regions \\(r_{1}\\) and \\(r_{2}\\) get connected, and the regions \\(r_{3}\\) and \\(r_{4}\\) remain separated at \\(p\\) (see Figure 11). If \\(p\\) is an odd point, then \\(r_{1}\\) and \\(r_{2}\\) are odd, so two odd regions are connected at \\(p\\). Otherwise, if \\(p\\) is even, then we have two even regions connected at \\(p\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-50}\n\nFigure 11\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-50(1)}\n\nFigure 12\n\nConsider the system of odd regions and their connections at the odd points as a graph. In this graph the odd regions are the vertices, and each odd point establishes an edge that connects two vertices (see Figure 12).

For every odd \\(n\\) there exists at least one configuration of \\(n\\) circles with a single snail orbit. Figure 13 shows a possible configuration with 5 circles. In general, if a circle is rotated by \\(k \\cdot \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{n}\\) \\((k=1,2, \\ldots, n-1)\\) around an interior point other than the centre, the circle and its rotated copies together provide a single snail orbit.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-50(2)}\n\nFigure 13"}

Let the line \\(A M\\) intersect the line \\(S T\\) and the circle \\(\\omega\\) (for the second time) at \\(N\\) and \\(L\\), respectively (see Figure 1).\n\nSince \\(E F \\| T S\\) and \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(E F, N\\) is the midpoint of \\(S T\\). Moreover, since \\(K\\) and \\(M\\) are symmetric to each other with respect to the line \\(S T\\), we have \\(\\angle K N S=\\angle M N S=\\) \\(\\angle L N T\\).

We have just proved that all interesting triangles are similar to each other. This allows us to use the following lemma.\n\nLemma. Let \\(A B C\\) be an arbitrary triangle. Choose two points \\(E_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2}\\) on the side \\(A C\\), two points \\(F_{1}\\) and \\(F_{2}\\) on the side \\(A B\\), and two points \\(K_{1}\\) and \\(K_{2}\\) on the side \\(B C\\), in a way that the triangles \\(E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}\\) are similar. Then the six circumcircles of the triangles \\(A E_{i} F_{i}\\), \\(B F_{i} K_{i}\\), and \\(C E_{i} K_{i}(i=1,2)\\) meet at a common point \\(Z\\). Moreover, \\(Z\\) is the centre of the spiral similarity that takes the triangle \\(E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}\\) to the triangle \\(E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}\\).\nProof. Firstly, notice that for each \\(i=1,2\\), the circumcircles of the triangles \\(A E_{i} F_{i}, B F_{i} K_{i}\\), and \\(C K_{i} E_{i}\\) have a common point \\(Z_{i}\\) by Miquel's theorem. Moreover, we have\n\\(\\npreceq\\left(Z_{i} F_{i}, Z_{i} E_{i}\\right)=\\npreceq(A B, C A), \\quad \\npreceq\\left(Z_{i} K_{i}, Z_{i} F_{i}\\right)=\\npreceq(B C, A B), \\quad \\npreceq\\left(Z_{i} E_{i}, Z_{i} K_{i}\\right)=\\npreceq(C A, B C)\\).\nThis yields that the points \\(Z_{1}\\) and \\(Z_{2}\\) correspond to each other in similar triangles \\(E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}\\). Thus, if they coincide, then this common point is indeed the desired centre of a spiral similarity.\n\nFinally, in order to show that \\(Z_{1}=Z_{2}\\), one may notice that \\(\\Varangle\\left(A B, A Z_{1}\\right)=\\Varangle\\left(E_{1} F_{1}, E_{1} Z_{1}\\right)=\\) \\(\\npreceq\\left(E_{2} F_{2}, E_{2} Z_{2}\\right)=\\npreceq\\left(A B, A Z_{2}\\right)\\) (see Figure 2). Similarly, one has \\(\\npreceq\\left(B C, B Z_{1}\\right)=\\npreceq\\left(B C, B Z_{2}\\right)\\) and \\(\\Varangle\\left(C A, C Z_{1}\\right)=\\Varangle\\left(C A, C Z_{2}\\right)\\). This yields \\(Z_{1}=Z_{2}\\).\n\nNow, let \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be the feet of the perpendiculars from \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) onto \\(A C\\) and \\(A B\\), respectively, and let \\(R\\) be the midpoint of \\(B C\\) (see Figure 3). Then \\(R\\) is the circumcentre of the cyclic quadrilateral \\(B C P Q\\). Thus we obtain \\(\\angle A P Q=\\angle B\\) and \\(\\angle R P C=\\angle C\\), which yields \\(\\angle Q P R=\\angle A\\). Similarly, we show that \\(\\angle P Q R=\\angle A\\). Thus, all interesting triangles are similar to the triangle \\(P Q R\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-60(1)}\n\nFigure 3\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-60}\n\nFigure 4\n\nDenote now by \\(Z\\) the common point of the circumcircles of \\(A P Q, B Q R\\), and \\(C P R\\). Let \\(E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}\\) be two interesting triangles. By the lemma, \\(Z\\) is the centre of any spiral similarity taking one of the triangles \\(E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}, E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}\\), and \\(P Q R\\) to some other of them. Therefore the triangles \\(Z E_{1} E_{2}\\) and \\(Z F_{1} F_{2}\\) are similar, as well as the triangles \\(Z E_{1} F_{1}\\) and \\(Z P Q\\). Hence\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_{1} E_{2}}{F_{1} F_{2}}=\\frac{Z E_{1}}{Z F_{1}}=\\frac{Z P}{Z Q}\n\\]\n\nMoreover, the equalities \\(\\angle A Z Q=\\angle A P Q=\\angle A B C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle Q Z R\\) show that the point \\(Z\\) lies on the line \\(A R\\) (see Figure 4). Therefore the triangles \\(A Z P\\) and \\(A C R\\) are similar, as well as the triangles \\(A Z Q\\) and \\(A B R\\). This yields\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Z P}{Z Q}=\\frac{Z P}{R C} \\cdot \\frac{R B}{Z Q}=\\frac{A Z}{A C} \\cdot \\frac{A B}{A Z}=\\frac{A B}{A C}\n\\]\n\nwhich completes the solution.\n\nSecond method. Now we will start from the fact that \\(\\omega_{1}\\) is tangent to the lines \\(K E\\) and \\(K F\\) (see Figure 5). We prove that if ( \\(E, F\\) ) is an interesting pair, then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A E}{A B}+\\frac{A F}{A C}=2 \\cos \\angle A .\n\\]\n\nLet \\(Y\\) be the intersection point of the segments \\(B E\\) and \\(C F\\). The points \\(B, K\\), and \\(C\\) are collinear, hence applying PASCAL's theorem to the degenerated hexagon AFFYEE, we infer that \\(Y\\) lies on the circle \\(\\omega_{1}\\).\n\nDenote by \\(Z\\) the second intersection point of the circumcircle of the triangle \\(B F Y\\) with the line \\(B C\\) (see Figure 6). By Miquel's theorem, the points \\(C, Z, Y\\), and \\(E\\) are concyclic. Therefore we obtain\n\n\\[\nB F \\cdot A B+C E \\cdot A C=B Y \\cdot B E+C Y \\cdot C F=B Z \\cdot B C+C Z \\cdot B C=B C^{2} .\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, \\(B C^{2}=A B^{2}+A C^{2}-2 A B \\cdot A C \\cos \\angle A\\), by the cosine law. Hence\n\n\\[\n(A B-A F) \\cdot A B+(A C-A E) \\cdot A C=A B^{2}+A C^{2}-2 A B \\cdot A C \\cos \\angle A,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to the desired equality (1).\nLet now ( \\(E_{1}, F_{1}\\) ) and ( \\(E_{2}, F_{2}\\) ) be two interesting pairs of points. Then we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A E_{1}}{A B}+\\frac{A F_{1}}{A C}=\\frac{A E_{2}}{A B}+\\frac{A F_{2}}{A C},\n\\]\n\nwhich gives the desired result.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-61(1)}\n\nFigure 5\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-61}\n\nFigure 6\n\nThird method. Again, we make use of the fact that all interesting triangles are similar (and equi-oriented). Let us put the picture onto a complex plane such that \\(A\\) is at the origin, and identify each point with the corresponding complex number.\n\nLet \\(E F K\\) be any interesting triangle. The equalities \\(\\angle K E F=\\angle K F E=\\angle A\\) yield that the ratio \\(\\nu=\\frac{K-E}{F-E}\\) is the same for all interesting triangles. This in turn means that the numbers \\(E\\), \\(F\\), and \\(K\\) satisfy the linear equation\n\n\\[\nK=\\mu E+\\nu F, \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\mu=1-\\nu .\n\\]\n\nNow let us choose the points \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) on the rays \\(A B\\) and \\(A C\\), respectively, so that \\(\\angle C X A=\\angle A Y B=\\angle A=\\angle K E F\\) (see Figure 7). Then each of the triangles \\(A X C\\) and \\(Y A B\\) is similar to any interesting triangle, which also means that\n\n\\[\nC=\\mu A+\\nu X=\\nu X \\quad \\text { and } \\quad B=\\mu Y+\\nu A=\\mu Y\n\\]\n\nMoreover, one has \\(X / Y=\\overline{C / B}\\).\nSince the points \\(E, F\\), and \\(K\\) lie on \\(A C, A B\\), and \\(B C\\), respectively, one gets\n\n\\[\nE=\\rho Y, \\quad F=\\sigma X, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad K=\\lambda B+(1-\\lambda) C\n\\]\n\nfor some real \\(\\rho, \\sigma\\), and \\(\\lambda\\). In view of (3), the equation (2) now reads \\(\\lambda B+(1-\\lambda) C=K=\\) \\(\\mu E+\\nu F=\\rho B+\\sigma C\\), or\n\n\\[\n(\\lambda-\\rho) B=(\\sigma+\\lambda-1) C\n\\]\n\nSince the nonzero complex numbers \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) have different arguments, the coefficients in the brackets vanish, so \\(\\rho=\\lambda\\) and \\(\\sigma=1-\\lambda\\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{Y}+\\frac{F}{X}=\\rho+\\sigma=1\n\\]\n\nNow, if ( \\(E_{1}, F_{1}\\) ) and ( \\(E_{2}, F_{2}\\) ) are two distinct interesting pairs, one may apply (4) to both pairs. Subtracting, we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{Y}=\\frac{F_{2}-F_{1}}{X}, \\quad \\text { so } \\quad \\frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{F_{2}-F_{1}}=\\frac{Y}{X}=\\frac{\\bar{B}}{\\bar{C}} .\n\\]\n\nTaking absolute values provides the required result.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-62}\n\nFigure 7\n\nComment 1. One may notice that the triangle \\(P Q R\\) is also interesting.\n\nComment 2. In order to prove that \\(\\angle K E F=\\angle K F E=\\angle A\\), one may also use the following well-known fact:\nLet \\(A E F\\) be a triangle with \\(A E \\neq A F\\), and let \\(K\\) be the common point of the symmedian taken from \\(A\\) and the perpendicular bisector of \\(E F\\). Then the lines \\(K E\\) and \\(K F\\) are tangent to the circumcircle \\(\\omega_{1}\\) of the triangle \\(A E F\\).\n\nIn this case, however, one needs to deal with the case \\(A E=A F\\) separately.\n\nSolution 2. Let \\((E, F)\\) be an interesting pair. This time we prove that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A M}{A K}=\\cos \\angle A\n\\]\n\nAs in Solution 1, we introduce the circle \\(\\omega\\) passing through the points \\(K, S, A\\), and \\(T\\), together with the points \\(N\\) and \\(L\\) at which the line \\(A M\\) intersect the line \\(S T\\) and the circle \\(\\omega\\) for the second time, respectively. Let moreover \\(O\\) be the centre of \\(\\omega\\) (see Figures 8 and 9). As in Solution 1, we note that \\(N\\) is the midpoint of \\(S T\\) and show that \\(K L \\| S T\\), which implies \\(\\angle F A M=\\angle E A K\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-63(1)}\n\nFigure 8\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-63}\n\nFigure 9\n\nSuppose now that \\(K \\neq L\\) (see Figure 8). Then \\(K L \\| S T\\), and consequently the lines \\(K M\\) and \\(K L\\) are perpendicular. It implies that the lines \\(L O\\) and \\(K M\\) meet at a point \\(X\\) lying on the circle \\(\\omega\\). Since the lines \\(O N\\) and \\(X M\\) are both perpendicular to the line \\(S T\\), they are parallel to each other, and hence \\(\\angle L O N=\\angle L X K=\\angle M A K\\). On the other hand, \\(\\angle O L N=\\angle M K A\\), so we infer that triangles \\(N O L\\) and \\(M A K\\) are similar. This yields\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A M}{A K}=\\frac{O N}{O L}=\\frac{O N}{O T}=\\cos \\angle T O N=\\cos \\angle A .\n\\]\n\nIf, on the other hand, \\(K=L\\), then the points \\(A, M, N\\), and \\(K\\) lie on a common line, and this line is the perpendicular bisector of \\(S T\\) (see Figure 9). This implies that \\(A K\\) is a diameter of \\(\\omega\\), which yields \\(A M=2 O K-2 N K=2 O N\\). So also in this case we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A M}{A K}=\\frac{2 O N}{2 O T}=\\cos \\angle T O N=\\cos \\angle A .\n\\]\n\nThus (5) is proved.\nLet \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be the feet of the perpendiculars from \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) onto \\(A C\\) and \\(A B\\), respectively (see Figure 10). We claim that the point \\(M\\) lies on the line \\(P Q\\). Consider now the composition of the dilatation with factor \\(\\cos \\angle A\\) and centre \\(A\\), and the reflection with respect to the angle bisector of \\(\\angle B A C\\). This transformation is a similarity that takes \\(B, C\\), and \\(K\\) to \\(P, Q\\), and \\(M\\), respectively. Since \\(K\\) lies on the line \\(B C\\), the point \\(M\\) lies on the line \\(P Q\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-64}\n\nFigure 10\nSuppose that \\(E \\neq P\\). Then also \\(F \\neq Q\\), and by Menelaus' theorem, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A Q}{F Q} \\cdot \\frac{F M}{E M} \\cdot \\frac{E P}{A P}=1\n\\]\n\nUsing the similarity of the triangles \\(A P Q\\) and \\(A B C\\), we infer that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E P}{F Q}=\\frac{A P}{A Q}=\\frac{A B}{A C}, \\quad \\text { and hence } \\quad \\frac{E P}{A B}=\\frac{F Q}{A C} .\n\\]\n\nThe last equality holds obviously also in case \\(E=P\\), because then \\(F=Q\\). Moreover, since the line \\(P Q\\) intersects the segment \\(E F\\), we infer that the point \\(E\\) lies on the segment \\(A P\\) if and only if the point \\(F\\) lies outside of the segment \\(A Q\\).\n\nLet now ( \\(E_{1}, F_{1}\\) ) and ( \\(E_{2}, F_{2}\\) ) be two interesting pairs. Then we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_{1} P}{A B}=\\frac{F_{1} Q}{A C} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{E_{2} P}{A B}=\\frac{F_{2} Q}{A C}\n\\]\n\nIf \\(P\\) lies between the points \\(E_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2}\\), we add the equalities above, otherwise we subtract them. In any case we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_{1} E_{2}}{A B}=\\frac{F_{1} F_{2}}{A C},\n\\]\n\nwhich completes the solution."}

Set \\(\\alpha=\\angle A / 2, \\beta=\\angle B / 2, \\gamma=\\angle C / 2\\). Then obviously \\(\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma=90^{\\circ}\\). Since \\(\\angle U I C=90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain \\(\\angle I U C=\\alpha+\\beta\\). Therefore \\(\\angle B I V=\\angle I U C-\\angle I B C=\\alpha=\\angle B A I=\\angle B Y V\\), which implies that the points \\(B, Y, I\\), and \\(V\\) lie on a common circle (see Figure 1).\n\nAssume now that the points \\(I, X\\) and \\(Y\\) are collinear. We prove that \\(\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}\\).\nLet the line \\(X U\\) intersect \\(A B\\) at \\(N\\).

Therefore, since \\(\\angle X I A=90^{\\circ}\\), the point \\(T\\) is the midpoint of \\(A X\\), i.e., \\(T=W\\).\n\nTo complete our solution, it remains to show that the intersection point of the lines IS and \\(B C\\) coincide with the midpoint of the segment \\(B C\\). But since \\(S\\) is the midpoint of the segment \\(V C\\), it suffices to show that the lines \\(B V\\) and \\(I S\\) are parallel.\n\nSince the quadrilateral \\(B Y I V\\) is cyclic, \\(\\angle V B I=\\angle V Y I=\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}\\).

This completes the solution.\n\nSolution 2. As in Solution 1, we first prove that the points \\(B, Y, I, V\\) lie on a common circle and \\(\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}\\). The remaining part of the solution is based on the following lemma, which holds true for any triangle \\(A B C\\), not necessarily with the property that \\(I, X, Y\\) are collinear. Lemma. Let \\(A B C\\) be the triangle inscribed in a circle \\(\\Gamma\\) and let \\(I\\) be its incentre. Assume that the line passing through \\(I\\) and perpendicular to the line \\(A I\\) intersects the side \\(A B\\) at the point \\(Y\\). Let the circumcircle of the triangle \\(B Y I\\) intersect the circle \\(\\Gamma\\) for the second time at \\(V\\), and let the excircle of the triangle \\(A B C\\) opposite to the vertex \\(A\\) be tangent to the side \\(B C\\) at \\(E\\). Then\n\n\\[\n\\angle B A V=\\angle C A E\n\\]\n\nProof. Let \\(\\rho\\) be the composition of the inversion with centre \\(A\\) and radius \\(\\sqrt{A B \\cdot A C}\\), and the symmetry with respect to \\(A I\\). Clearly, \\(\\rho\\) interchanges \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\n\nLet \\(J\\) be the excentre of the triangle \\(A B C\\) opposite to \\(A\\) (see Figure 2). Then we have \\(\\angle J A C=\\angle B A I\\) and \\(\\angle J C A=90^{\\circ}+\\gamma=\\angle B I A\\), so the triangles \\(A C J\\) and \\(A I B\\) are similar, and therefore \\(A B \\cdot A C=A I \\cdot A J\\). This means that \\(\\rho\\) interchanges \\(I\\) and \\(J\\). Moreover, since \\(Y\\) lies on \\(A B\\) and \\(\\angle A I Y=90^{\\circ}\\), the point \\(Y^{\\prime}=\\rho(Y)\\) lies on \\(A C\\), and \\(\\angle J Y^{\\prime} A=90^{\\circ}\\). Thus \\(\\rho\\) maps the circumcircle \\(\\gamma\\) of the triangle \\(B Y I\\) to a circle \\(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\) with diameter \\(J C\\).\n\nFinally, since \\(V\\) lies on both \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\gamma\\), the point \\(V^{\\prime}=\\rho(V)\\) lies on the line \\(\\rho(\\Gamma)=A B\\) as well as on \\(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\), which in turn means that \\(V^{\\prime}=E\\). This implies the desired result.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-66}\n\nFigure 2\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-66(1)}\n\nFigure 3\n\nNow we turn to the solution of the problem.\nAssume that the incircle \\(\\omega_{1}\\) of the triangle \\(A B C\\) is tangent to \\(B C\\) at \\(D\\), and let the excircle \\(\\omega_{2}\\) of the triangle \\(A B C\\) opposite to the vertex \\(A\\) touch the side \\(B C\\) at \\(E\\) (see Figure 3 ). The homothety with centre \\(A\\) that takes \\(\\omega_{2}\\) to \\(\\omega_{1}\\) takes the point \\(E\\) to some point \\(F\\), and the\ntangent to \\(\\omega_{1}\\) at \\(F\\) is parallel to \\(B C\\). Therefore \\(D F\\) is a diameter of \\(\\omega_{1}\\). Moreover, \\(Z\\) is the midpoint of \\(D E\\). This implies that the lines \\(I Z\\) and \\(F E\\) are parallel.\n\nLet \\(K=Y I \\cap A E\\). Since \\(\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}\\), the lemma yields that \\(I\\) is the midpoint of \\(X K\\). This implies that the segments \\(I W\\) and \\(A K\\) are parallel. Therefore, the points \\(W, I\\) and \\(Z\\) are collinear.\n\nComment 1. The properties \\(\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}\\) and \\(V A=V C\\) can be established in various ways. The main difficulty of the problem seems to find out how to use these properties in connection to the points \\(W\\) and \\(Z\\).\n\nIn Solution 2 this principal part is more or less covered by the lemma, for which we have presented a direct proof. On the other hand, this lemma appears to be a combination of two well-known facts; let us formulate them in terms of the lemma statement.\n\nLet the line \\(I Y\\) intersect \\(A C\\) at \\(P\\) (see Figure 4). The first fact states that the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\) of the triangle \\(V Y P\\) is tangent to the segments \\(A B\\) and \\(A C\\), as well as to the circle \\(\\Gamma\\). The second fact states that for such a circle, the angles \\(B A V\\) and \\(C A E\\) are equal.\n\nThe awareness of this lemma may help a lot in solving this problem; so the Jury might also consider a variation of the proposed problem, for which the lemma does not seem to be useful; see Comment 3.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-67}\n\nComment 2. The proposed problem stated the equivalence: the point \\(I\\) lies on the line \\(X Y\\) if and only if \\(I\\) lies on the line \\(W Z\\). Here we sketch the proof of the \"if\" part (see Figure 5).\nAs in Solution 2, let \\(B C\\) touch the circles \\(\\omega_{1}\\) and \\(\\omega_{2}\\) at \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), respectively. Since \\(I Z \\| A E\\) and \\(W\\) lies on \\(I Z\\), the line \\(D X\\) is also parallel to \\(A E\\). Therefore, the triangles \\(X U P\\) and \\(A I Q\\) are similar. Moreover, the line \\(D X\\) is symmetric to \\(A E\\) with respect to \\(I\\), so \\(I P=I Q\\), where \\(P=U V \\cap X D\\) and \\(Q=U V \\cap A E\\). Thus we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\frac{U V}{V I}=\\frac{U X}{I A}=\\frac{U P}{I Q}=\\frac{U P}{I P} .\n\\]\n\nSo the pairs \\(I U\\) and \\(P V\\) are harmonic conjugates, and since \\(\\angle U D I=90^{\\circ}\\), we get \\(\\angle V D B=\\angle B D X=\\) \\(\\angle B E A\\). Therefore the point \\(V^{\\prime}\\) symmetric to \\(V\\) with respect to the perpendicular bisector of \\(B C\\) lies on the line \\(A E\\). So we obtain \\(\\angle B A V=\\angle C A E\\).\n\nThe rest can be obtained by simply reversing the arguments in Solution 2. The points \\(B, V, I\\), and \\(Y\\) are concyclic. The lemma implies that \\(\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}\\). Moreover, the points \\(B, U, I\\), and \\(N\\), where \\(N=U X \\cap A B\\), lie on a common circle, so \\(I N=I U\\). Since \\(I Y \\perp U N\\), the point \\(X^{\\prime}=I Y \\cap U N\\) is the midpoint of \\(U N\\). But in the trapezoid \\(A Y V I\\), the line \\(X U\\) is parallel to the sides \\(A I\\) and \\(Y V\\), so \\(N X=U X^{\\prime}\\). This yields \\(X=X^{\\prime}\\).\nThe reasoning presented in Solution 1 can also be reversed, but it requires a lot of technicalities. Therefore the Problem Selection Committee proposes to consider only the \"only if\" part of the original proposal, which is still challenging enough.\n\nComment 3. The Jury might also consider the following variation of the proposed problem.\nLet \\(A B C\\) be a triangle with circumcircle \\(\\Omega\\) and incentre \\(I\\). Let the line through \\(I\\) perpendicular to \\(C I\\) intersect the segment \\(B C\\) and the arc \\(B C\\) (not containing \\(A\\) ) of \\(\\Omega\\) at \\(U\\) and \\(V\\), respectively. Let the line through \\(U\\) parallel to AI intersect AV at X. Prove that if the lines XI and AI are perpendicular, then the midpoint of the segment \\(A C\\) lies on the line XI (see Figure 6).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-68}\n\nFigure 6\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_9bb46cbb35375004ecb7g-68(1)}\n\nFigure 7\n\nSince the solution contains the arguments used above, we only sketch it.\nLet \\(N=X U \\cap A B\\) (see Figure 7). Then \\(\\angle B N U=\\angle B A I=\\angle B I U\\), so the points \\(B, U, I\\), and \\(N\\) lie on a common circle. Therefore \\(I U=I N\\), and since \\(I X \\perp N U\\), it follows that \\(N X=X U\\).\nNow set \\(Y=X I \\cap A B\\). The equality \\(N X=X U\\) implies that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V X}{V A}=\\frac{X U}{A I}=\\frac{N X}{A I}=\\frac{Y X}{Y I}\n\\]\n\nand therefore \\(Y V \\| A I\\). Hence \\(\\angle B Y V=\\angle B A I=\\angle B I V\\), so the points \\(B, V, I, Y\\) are concyclic. Next we have \\(I Y \\perp Y V\\), so \\(\\angle I B V=90^{\\circ}\\). This implies that \\(B V\\) is the external angle bisector of the angle \\(A B C\\), which gives \\(\\angle V A C=\\angle V C A\\).\nSo in order to show that \\(M=X I \\cap A C\\) is the midpoint of \\(A C\\), it suffices to prove that \\(\\angle V M C=90^{\\circ}\\). But this follows immediately from the observation that the points \\(V, C, M\\), and \\(I\\) are concyclic, as \\(\\angle M I V=\\angle Y B V=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A C V\\) 。\nThe converse statement is also true, but its proof requires some technicalities as well."}

It is a natural idea to compare the sum \\(S_{n}(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1+x^{2 k}}{1+x^{4 k}}\\) with the integral \\(I_{n}(x)=\\) \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\frac{1+x^{2 t}}{1+x^{4 t}} \\mathrm{~d} t\\). Though computing the integral is quite standard, many difficulties arise. First, the integrand \\(\\frac{1+x^{2 k}}{1+x^{4 k}}\\) has an increasing segment and, depending on \\(x\\), it can have a decreasing segment as well.

Now we solve this system and show that the solution is unique and satisfies conditions (a) and (b).\n\nFirst, observe that any solution of the system (3), (6) satisfies the condition (b). By the construction, equations (6) immediately imply (5). On the other hand, all inequalities mentioned in condition (b) are included into the chain (5) for some value of \\(u\\).\n\nNext, note that the system (3), (6) is redundant. The numbers \\(S(k n,(k+1) n]\\), where \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\), appear twice in (6). For \\(u=0\\) and \\(v=k\\) we have \\(v \\leq n-u-1\\), and (6) gives \\(S(k n,(k+1) n]=v=k\\). For \\(u=n\\) and \\(v=k-1\\) we have \\(v \\geq n-u\\) and we obtain the same value, \\(S(k n,(k+1) n]=v+1=k\\). Therefore, deleting one equation from each redundant pair, we can make every sum \\(S(k, k+n]\\) appear exactly once on the left-hand side in (6).\n\nNow, from (3), (6), the sequence ( \\(a_{i}\\) ) can be reconstructed inductively by\n\\(a_{1}=a_{2}=\\ldots=a_{n-1}=0, \\quad a_{k+n}=S(k, k+n]-\\left(a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+\\ldots+a_{k+n-1}\\right) \\quad\\left(0 \\leq k \\leq n^{2}\\right)\\),\ntaking the values of \\(S(k, k+n]\\) from (6). This means first that there exists at most one solution of our system. Conversely, the constructed sequence obviously satisfies all equations (3), (6) (the only missing equation is \\(a_{n}=0\\), which follows from \\(S(0, n]=0\\) ). Hence it satisfies condition (b), and we are left to check condition (a) only.\n\nFor arbitrary integers \\(1 \\leq u, t \\leq n\\) we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{u+t n}-a_{u+(t-1) n} & =S(u+(t-1) n, u+t n]-S((u-1)+(t-1) n,(u-1)+t n] \n& = \\begin{cases}(t-1)-(t-1)=0, & t \\leq n-u \nt-(t-1)=1, & t=n-u+1 \nt-t=0, & t \\geq n-u+2\n\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a_{u}=0\\), we have\n\n\\[\na_{u+v n}=a_{u+v n}-a_{u}=\\sum_{t=1}^{v}\\left(a_{u+t n}-a_{u+(t-1) n}\\right)\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(1 \\leq u, v \\leq n\\). If \\(v<n-u+1\\) then all terms are 0 on the right-hand side. If \\(v \\geq n-u+1\\), then variable \\(t\\) attains the value \\(n-u+1\\) once. Hence,\n\n\\[\na_{u+v n}= \\begin{cases}0, & u+v \\leq n \\\\ 1, & u+v \\geq n+1\n\\]\n\naccording with (1). Note that the formula is valid for \\(v=0\\) as well.\nFinally, we presented the direct formula for \\(\\left(a_{i}\\right)\\), and we have proved that it satisfies condition (a).

It has no common point with \\(A D\\) (otherwise it has a common side with \\(a\\) ), as well as no common point with \\(A B\\) or with \\(B C\\) (obviously). Then \\(d\\) has a common point with \\(C D\\). Hence its right side provides a splitting line, and we get the contradiction again.\n\nSolution 2. Again, we suppose the contrary. Consider an arbitrary counterexample. Then we know that each rectangle is attached to at least one side of the square. Observe that a rectangle cannot be attached to two opposite sides, otherwise one of its sides lies on a splitting line.\n\nWe say that two rectangles are opposite if they are attached to opposite sides of \\(A B C D\\). We claim that there exist two opposite rectangles having a common point.\n\nConsider the union \\(L\\) of all rectangles attached to the left. Assume, to the contrary, that \\(L\\) has no common point with the rectangles attached to the right. Take a polygonal line \\(p\\) connecting the top and the bottom sides of the square and passing close from the right to the boundary of \\(L\\) (see Figure 4). Then all its points belong to the rectangles attached either to the top or to the bottom. Moreover, the upper end-point of \\(p\\) belongs to a rectangle attached to the top, and the lower one belongs to an other rectangle attached to the bottom. Hence, there is a point on \\(p\\) where some rectangles attached to the top and to the bottom meet each other. So, there always exists a pair of neighboring opposite rectangles.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_aef3a5182623580877e3g-29(2)}\n\nFigure 4\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_aef3a5182623580877e3g-29}\n\nFigure 5\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_aef3a5182623580877e3g-29(1)}\n\nFigure 6\n\nNow, take two opposite neighboring rectangles \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). We can assume that \\(a\\) is attached to the left and \\(b\\) is attached to the right. Let \\(X\\) be their common point. If \\(X\\) belongs to their horizontal sides (in particular, \\(X\\) may appear to be a common vertex of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) ), then these sides provide a splitting line (see Figure 5). Otherwise, \\(X\\) lies on the vertical sides. Let \\(\\ell\\) be the line containing these sides.\n\nSince \\(\\ell\\) is not a splitting line, it intersects the interior of some rectangle. Let \\(c\\) be such a rectangle, closest to \\(X\\); we can assume that \\(c\\) lies above \\(X\\). Let \\(Y\\) be the common point of \\(\\ell\\) and the bottom side of \\(c\\) (see Figure 6). Then \\(Y\\) is also a vertex of two rectangles lying below \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let \\(Y\\) be the upper-right and upper-left corners of the rectangles \\(a^{\\prime}\\) and \\(b^{\\prime}\\), respectively. Then \\(a^{\\prime}\\) and \\(b^{\\prime}\\) are situated not lower than \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), respectively (it may happen that \\(a=a^{\\prime}\\) or \\(\\left.b=b^{\\prime}\\right)\\). We claim that \\(a^{\\prime}\\) is attached to the left. If \\(a=a^{\\prime}\\) then of course it is. If \\(a \\neq a^{\\prime}\\) then \\(a^{\\prime}\\) is above \\(a\\), below \\(c\\) and to the left from \\(b^{\\prime}\\). Hence, it can be attached to the left only.\n\nAnalogously, \\(b^{\\prime}\\) is attached to the right. Now, the top sides of these two rectangles pass through \\(Y\\), hence they provide a splitting line again. This last contradiction completes the proof."}

Again, we prove that area \\(\\left(A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{area}(A B C)\\).\nWe can assume that \\(P\\) lies on arc \\(A C\\).

Let \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}\\) be the midpoints of sides \\(B C, C A\\) and \\(A B\\), respectively.\nSuppose that two of points \\(A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}\\) lie in one of triangles \\(A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}\\) (for convenience, let points \\(B_{1}\\) and \\(C_{1}\\) lie in triangle \\(A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}\\); see Figure 2). Let segments \\(B_{1} C_{1}\\) and \\(A A_{1}\\) intersect at point \\(X\\). Then \\(X\\) also lies in triangle \\(A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}\\).

Then lines \\(B_{1} A_{1}\\) and \\(A B\\) intersect at a point \\(Y\\) on the extension of \\(A B\\) beyond point \\(B\\), hence \\(\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{C_{1} Y}{C^{\\prime} Y}>1\\); also, lines \\(A_{1} C^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C A\\) intersect at a point \\(Z\\) on the extension of \\(C A\\) beyond point \\(A\\), hence \\(\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{B_{1} Z}{B^{\\prime} Z}>1\\). Finally, since \\(A_{1} A^{\\prime} \\| B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\), we have \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]\\).\n\nNow, from \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]+\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]=[A B C]\\) we obtain that one of the remaining triangles \\(A C_{1} B_{1}, B A_{1} C_{1}, C B_{1} A_{1}\\) has an area less than \\(\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]\\), so it is less than \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]\\).\n\nNow we return to the problem. We say that triangle \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) is small if \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]\\) is less than each of \\(\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]\\); otherwise this triangle is big (the similar notion is introduced for triangles \\(B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}, C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}, D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\) ). If both triangles \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\) are big, then \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]\\) is not less than the area of some border triangle, and \\(\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right]\\) is not less than the area of another one; hence, \\(S_{1}=\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right] \\geq S\\). The same is valid for the pair of \\(B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}\\) and \\(D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\). So it is sufficient to prove that in one of these pairs both triangles are big.\n\nSuppose the contrary. Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) and \\(D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\) are small. We can assume also that \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq\\) [ \\(D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\) ].

This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) inside \\(L K B\\).\n\nCase 2. Ray \\(C_{1} D_{1}\\) does not intersect \\(A B\\). Then choose a \"sufficiently far\" point \\(K\\) on ray \\(B A\\) such that \\(\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]\\), and that ray \\(K C_{1}\\) intersects line \\(B C\\) at some point \\(L\\) (see Figure 5). Since ray \\(C_{1} D_{1}\\) does not intersect line \\(A B\\), the points \\(A\\) and \\(D_{1}\\) are on different sides of \\(K L\\); then \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) are also on different sides, and \\(C\\) is on the same side as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Then analogously we have \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L_{1} B_{1}\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]\\) since triangle \\(A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\) is small. This (together with \\(\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]\\) ) contradicts the Lemma again."}

On the circumcircle, let \\(P\\) be the point opposite to \\(A\\), and let the angle bisector \\(A I\\) intersect the circle again at \\(M\\). Since \\(A K=A P=2 R\\), triangle \\(A K P\\) is isosceles. It is known that \\(\\angle B A D=\\angle C A O\\), hence \\(\\angle D A I=\\angle B A I-\\angle B A D=\\angle C A I-\\) \\(\\angle C A O=\\angle O A I\\), and \\(A M\\) is the bisector line in triangle \\(A K P\\).

Hence \\(\\angle B_{1} T I=\\) \\(\\angle B_{1} A I=\\angle C A M=\\angle B A M=\\angle B P M\\) and \\(\\angle I B_{1} T=\\angle I A T=\\angle M A K=\\angle M A P=\\) \\(\\angle M B P\\).

Since \\(I A_{1}=I B_{1}\\), the right triangles \\(I E B_{1}\\) and \\(I F A_{1}\\) are congruent and \\(\\angle I E B_{1}=\\angle I F A_{1}\\). Since \\(\\beta>\\gamma, A_{1}\\) lies in the interior of segment \\(C D\\) and \\(F\\) lies in the interior of \\(A_{1} D\\). Hence, \\(\\angle I F C\\) is acute.

For every \\(n>r\\), we have\n\n\\[\na_{n}=\\max \\left\\{a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{k}}: \\text { the collection }\\left(i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k}\\right) \\text { satisfies }(4)\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nNow we denote\n\n\\[\ns=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq r} \\frac{a_{i}}{i}\n\\]\n\nand fix some index \\(\\ell \\leq r\\) such that \\(s=\\frac{a_{\\ell}}{\\ell}\\).\nConsider some \\(n \\geq r^{2} \\ell+2 r\\) and choose an expansion of \\(a_{n}\\) in the form (2), (4). Then we have \\(n=i_{1}+\\cdots+i_{k} \\leq r k\\), so \\(k \\geq n / r \\geq r \\ell+2\\). Suppose that none of the numbers \\(i_{3}, \\ldots, i_{k}\\) equals \\(\\ell\\). Then by the pigeonhole principle there is an index \\(1 \\leq j \\leq r\\) which appears among \\(i_{3}, \\ldots, i_{k}\\) at least \\(\\ell\\) times, and surely \\(j \\neq \\ell\\). Let us delete these \\(\\ell\\) occurrences of \\(j\\) from \\(\\left(i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k}\\right)\\), and add \\(j\\) occurrences of \\(\\ell\\) instead, obtaining a sequence \\(\\left(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, i_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\prime}\\right)\\) also satisfying (4). By Claim, we have\n\n\\[\na_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{k}}=a_{n} \\geq a_{i_{1}}+a_{i_{2}}+a_{i_{3}^{\\prime}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\prime}}\n\\]\n\nor, after removing the coinciding terms, \\(\\ell a_{j} \\geq j a_{\\ell}\\), so \\(\\frac{a_{\\ell}}{\\ell} \\leq \\frac{a_{j}}{j}\\). By the definition of \\(\\ell\\), this means that \\(\\ell a_{j}=j a_{\\ell}\\), hence\n\n\\[\na_{n}=a_{i_{1}}+a_{i_{2}}+a_{i_{3}^{\\prime}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\prime}} .\n\\]\n\nThus, for every \\(n \\geq r^{2} \\ell+2 r\\) we have found a representation of the form (2), (4) with \\(i_{j}=\\ell\\) for some \\(j \\geq 3\\). Rearranging the indices we may assume that \\(i_{k}=\\ell\\).\n\nFinally, observe that in this representation, the indices \\(\\left(i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k-1}\\right)\\) satisfy the conditions (4) with \\(n\\) replaced by \\(n-\\ell\\).

As in the previous solution, we involve the expansion (2), (3), and we fix some index \\(1 \\leq \\ell \\leq r\\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{\\ell}}{\\ell}=s=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq r} \\frac{a_{i}}{i}\n\\]\n\nNow, we introduce the sequence ( \\(b_{n}\\) ) as \\(b_{n}=a_{n}-s n\\); then \\(b_{\\ell}=0\\).\nWe prove by induction on \\(n\\) that \\(b_{n} \\leq 0\\), and ( \\(b_{n}\\) ) satisfies the same recurrence relation as \\(\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\). The base cases \\(n \\leq r\\) follow from the definition of \\(s\\). Now, for \\(n>r\\) from the induction hypothesis we have\n\n\\[\nb_{n}=\\max _{1 \\leq k \\leq n-1}\\left(a_{k}+a_{n-k}\\right)-n s=\\max _{1 \\leq k \\leq n-1}\\left(b_{k}+b_{n-k}+n s\\right)-n s=\\max _{1 \\leq k \\leq n-1}\\left(b_{k}+b_{n-k}\\right) \\leq 0\n\\]\n\nas required.\nNow, if \\(b_{k}=0\\) for all \\(1 \\leq k \\leq r\\), then \\(b_{n}=0\\) for all \\(n\\), hence \\(a_{n}=s n\\), and the statement is trivial.

Actually, for any \\(x \\in T\\), let \\(x=b_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+b_{i_{k}}\\left(i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k} \\leq r\\right)\\). Then among \\(b_{i_{j}}\\) 's there are at most \\(\\frac{M}{\\varepsilon}\\) nonzero terms (otherwise \\(x<\\frac{M}{\\varepsilon} \\cdot(-\\varepsilon)<-M\\) ). Thus \\(x\\) can be expressed in the same way with \\(k \\leq \\frac{M}{\\varepsilon}\\), and there is only a finite number of such sums.\n\nFinally, for every \\(t=1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\) we get that the sequence\n\n\\[\nb_{r+t}, b_{r+t+\\ell}, b_{r+t+2 \\ell}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nis non-decreasing and attains the finite number of values; therefore it is constant from some index.

The expression (7) can be found by considering the sum of the roots of the quadratic polynomial \\(q(x)=(x-b)(x-d)(x-f)-(x-a)(x-c)(x-e)\\).\n\nSolution 4. We introduce the expressions \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) as in the previous solutions. The idea of the solution is to change the values of variables \\(a, \\ldots, f\\) keeping the left-hand side unchanged and increasing the right-hand side; it will lead to a simpler inequality which can be proved in a direct way.\n\nNamely, we change the variables (i) keeping the (non-strict) inequalities \\(a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq\\) \\(e \\leq f\\); (ii) keeping the values of sums \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) unchanged; and finally (iii) increasing the values of \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\). Then the left-hand side of (1) remains unchanged, while the right-hand side increases. Hence, the inequality (1) (and even a non-strict version of (1)) for the changed values would imply the same (strict) inequality for the original values.\n\nFirst, we find the sufficient conditions for (ii) and (iii) to be satisfied.\nLemma. Let \\(x, y, z>0\\); denote \\(U(x, y, z)=x+y+z, v(x, y, z)=x y+x z+y z\\). Suppose that \\(x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}=x+y\\) but \\(|x-y| \\geq\\left|x^{\\prime}-y^{\\prime}\\right| ;\\) then we have \\(U\\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z\\right)=U(x, y, z)\\) and \\(v\\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z\\right) \\geq\\) \\(v(x, y, z)\\) with equality achieved only when \\(|x-y|=\\left|x^{\\prime}-y^{\\prime}\\right|\\).\nProof. The first equality is obvious. For the second, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv\\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z\\right)=z\\left(x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}\\right)+x^{\\prime} y^{\\prime} & =z\\left(x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}\\right)+\\frac{\\left(x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}-\\left(x^{\\prime}-y^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}}{4} \n& \\geq z(x+y)+\\frac{(x+y)^{2}-(x-y)^{2}}{4}=v(x, y, z)\n\n\\]\n\nwith the equality achieved only for \\(\\left(x^{\\prime}-y^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}=(x-y)^{2} \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{\\prime}-y^{\\prime}\\right|=|x-y|\\), as desired.\n\nNow, we apply Lemma several times making the following changes. For each change, we denote the new values by the same letters to avoid cumbersome notations.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Let \\(k=\\frac{d-c}{2}\\). Replace \\((b, c, d, e)\\) by \\((b+k, c+k, d-k, e-k)\\). After the change we have \\(a<b<c=d<e<f\\), the values of \\(S\\), \\(T\\) remain unchanged, but \\(\\sigma, \\tau\\) strictly increase by Lemma.\n  \\item Let \\(\\ell=\\frac{e-d}{2}\\). Replace \\((c, d, e, f)\\) by \\((c+\\ell, d+\\ell, e-\\ell, f-\\ell)\\). After the change we have \\(a<b<c=d=e<f\\), the values of \\(S, T\\) remain unchanged, but \\(\\sigma, \\tau\\) strictly increase by the Lemma.\n  \\item Finally, let \\(m=\\frac{c-b}{3}\\). Replace \\((a, b, c, d, e, f)\\) by \\((a+2 m, b+2 m, c-m, d-m, e-m, f-m)\\). After the change, we have \\(a<b=c=d=e<f\\) and \\(S, T\\) are unchanged. To check (iii), we observe that our change can be considered as a composition of two changes: \\((a, b, c, d) \\rightarrow\\) \\((a+m, b+m, c-m, d-m)\\) and \\((a, b, e, f) \\rightarrow(a+m, b+m, e-m, f-m)\\). It is easy to see that each of these two consecutive changes satisfy the conditions of the Lemma, hence the values of \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) increase.\n\n\nFinally, we come to the situation when \\(a<b=c=d=e<f\\), and we need to prove the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2(a+2 b)(2 b+f) & \\geq \\sqrt{3(a+4 b+f)\\left((a+2 b)\\left(b^{2}+2 b f\\right)+(2 b+f)\\left(2 a b+b^{2}\\right)\\right)} \n& =\\sqrt{3 b(a+4 b+f) \\cdot((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 b+f)(2 a+b))}\n\n\\]\n\nNow, observe that\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 2(a+2 b)(2 b+f)=3 b(a+4 b+f)+((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 a+b)(2 b+f))\n\\]\n\nHence (4) rewrites as\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 b(a+4 b+f) & +((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 a+b)(2 b+f)) \n& \\geq 2 \\sqrt{3 b(a+4 b+f) \\cdot((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 b+f)(2 a+b))}\n\n\\]\n\nwhich is simply the AM-GM inequality.\nComment 3. Here, we also can find all the cases of equality. Actually, it is easy to see that if some two numbers among \\(b, c, d, e\\) are distinct then one can use Lemma to increase the right-hand side of (1). Further, if \\(b=c=d=e\\), then we need equality in (4); this means that we apply AM-GM to equal numbers, that is,\n\n\\[\n3 b(a+4 b+f)=(a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 a+b)(2 b+f)\n\\]\n\nwhich leads to the same equality as in Comment 1 ."}

Yes, such an example exists.", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2010, "solution": "We say that an order of singers is good if it satisfied all their wishes. Next, we say that a number \\(N\\) is realizable by \\(k\\) singers (or \\(k\\)-realizable) if for some set of wishes of these singers there are exactly \\(N\\) good orders. Thus, we have to prove that a number 2010 is 20-realizable.\n\nWe start with the following simple\nLemma. Suppose that numbers \\(n_{1}, n_{2}\\) are realizable by respectively \\(k_{1}\\) and \\(k_{2}\\) singers. Then the number \\(n_{1} n_{2}\\) is ( \\(k_{1}+k_{2}\\) )-realizable.\nProof. Let the singers \\(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{k_{1}}\\) (with some wishes among them) realize \\(n_{1}\\), and the singers \\(B_{1}\\), \\(\\ldots, B_{k_{2}}\\) (with some wishes among them) realize \\(n_{2}\\). Add to each singer \\(B_{i}\\) the wish to perform later than all the singers \\(A_{j}\\). Then, each good order of the obtained set of singers has the form \\(\\left(A_{i_{1}}, \\ldots, A_{i_{k_{1}}}, B_{j_{1}}, \\ldots, B_{j_{k_{2}}}\\right)\\), where ( \\(A_{i_{1}}, \\ldots, A_{i_{k_{1}}}\\) ) is a good order for \\(A_{i}\\) 's and ( \\(B_{j_{1}}, \\ldots, B_{j_{k_{2}}}\\) ) is a good order for \\(B_{j}\\) 's. Conversely, each order of this form is obviously good. Hence, the number of good orders is \\(n_{1} n_{2}\\).\n\nIn view of Lemma, we show how to construct sets of singers containing 4, 3 and 13 singers and realizing the numbers 5,6 and 67 , respectively. Thus the number \\(2010=6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 67\\) will be realizable by \\(4+3+13=20\\) singers. These companies of singers are shown in Figs. 1-3; the wishes are denoted by arrows, and the number of good orders for each Figure stands below in the brackets.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-24}\n\nFig. 1\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-24(1)}\n(67)\n\nFig. 3\n\nFor Fig. 1, there are exactly 5 good orders \\((a, b, c, d),(a, b, d, c),(b, a, c, d),(b, a, d, c)\\), ( \\(b, d, a, c\\) ). For Fig. 2, each of 6 orders is good since there are no wishes.\n\nFinally, for Fig. 3, the order of \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{11}\\) is fixed; in this line, singer \\(x\\) can stand before each of \\(a_{i}(i \\leq 9)\\), and singer \\(y\\) can stand after each of \\(a_{j}(j \\geq 5)\\), thus resulting in \\(9 \\cdot 7=63\\) cases. Further, the positions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this line determine the whole order uniquely unless both of them come between the same pair ( \\(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\\) ) (thus \\(5 \\leq i \\leq 8\\) ); in the latter cases, there are two orders instead of 1 due to the order of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Hence, the total number of good orders is \\(63+4=67\\), as desired.\n\nComment. The number 20 in the problem statement is not sharp and is put there to respect the original formulation. So, if necessary, the difficulty level of this problem may be adjusted by replacing 20 by a smaller number. Here we present some improvements of the example leading to a smaller number of singers.\n\nSurely, each example with < 20 singers can be filled with some \"super-stars\" who should perform at the very end in a fixed order. Hence each of these improvements provides a different solution for the problem. Moreover, the large variety of ideas standing behind these examples allows to suggest that there are many other examples.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Instead of building the examples realizing 5 and 6 , it is more economic to make an example realizing 30; it may seem even simpler. Two possible examples consisting of 5 and 6 singers are shown in Fig. 4; hence the number 20 can be decreased to 19 or 18 .\n\n\nFor Fig. 4a, the order of \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{4}\\) is fixed, there are 5 ways to add \\(x\\) into this order, and there are 6 ways to add \\(y\\) into the resulting order of \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{4}, x\\). Hence there are \\(5 \\cdot 6=30\\) good orders.\n\nOn Fig. 4b, for 5 singers \\(a, b_{1}, b_{2}, c_{1}, c_{2}\\) there are \\(5!=120\\) orders at all. Obviously, exactly one half of them satisfies the wish \\(b_{1} \\leftarrow b_{2}\\), and exactly one half of these orders satisfies another wish \\(c_{1} \\leftarrow c_{2}\\); hence, there are exactly \\(5!/ 4=30\\) good orders.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-25}\n2. One can merge the examples for 30 and 67 shown in Figs. 4b and 3 in a smarter way, obtaining a set of 13 singers representing 2010. This example is shown in Fig. 5; an arrow from/to group \\(\\left\\{b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{5}\\right\\}\\) means that there exists such arrow from each member of this group.\n\nHere, as in Fig. 4b, one can see that there are exactly 30 orders of \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{5}, a_{6}, \\ldots, a_{11}\\) satisfying all their wishes among themselves.

First, we show that \\(M_{N}>2^{N-2}\\). Consider the collection of all \\(2^{N-2}\\) flags having yellow first squares and blue second ones. Obviously, both colors appear on the diagonal of each \\(N \\times N\\) square formed by these flags.\n\nWe are left to show that \\(M_{N} \\leq 2^{N-2}+1\\), thus obtaining the desired answer. We start with establishing this statement for \\(N=4\\).\n\nSuppose that we have 5 flags of length 4 . We decompose each flag into two parts of 2 squares each; thereby, we denote each flag as \\(L R\\), where the \\(2 \\times 1\\) flags \\(L, R \\in \\mathcal{S}=\\{\\mathrm{BB}, \\mathrm{BY}, \\mathrm{YB}, \\mathrm{YY}\\}\\) are its left and right parts, respectively. First, we make two easy observations on the flags \\(2 \\times 1\\) which can be checked manually.\n(i) For each \\(A \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), there exists only one \\(2 \\times 1\\) flag \\(C \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) (possibly \\(C=A\\) ) such that \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) cannot form a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square with monochrome diagonal (for part BB , that is YY , and for BY that is YB ).\n(ii) Let \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) be three distinct elements; then two of them can form a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square with yellow diagonal, and two of them can form a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square with blue diagonal (for all parts but BB , a pair (BY, YB) fits for both statements, while for all parts but BY, these pairs are \\((\\mathrm{YB}, \\mathrm{YY})\\) and \\((\\mathrm{BB}, \\mathrm{YB}))\\).\n\nNow, let \\(\\ell\\) and \\(r\\) be the numbers of distinct left and right parts of our 5 flags, respectively. The total number of flags is \\(5 \\leq r \\ell\\), hence one of the factors (say, \\(r\\) ) should be at least 3 . On the other hand, \\(\\ell, r \\leq 4\\), so there are two flags with coinciding right part; let them be \\(L_{1} R_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2} R_{1}\\left(L_{1} \\neq L_{2}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, since \\(r \\geq 3\\), there exist some flags \\(L_{3} R_{3}\\) and \\(L_{4} R_{4}\\) such that \\(R_{1}, R_{3}, R_{4}\\) are distinct. Let \\(L^{\\prime} R^{\\prime}\\) be the remaining flag. By (i), one of the pairs ( \\(L^{\\prime}, L_{1}\\) ) and ( \\(L^{\\prime}, L_{2}\\) ) can form a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square with monochrome diagonal; we can assume that \\(L^{\\prime}, L_{2}\\) form a square with a blue diagonal. Finally, the right parts of two of the flags \\(L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}\\) can also form a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these \\(2 \\times 2\\) squares on the diagonal of a \\(4 \\times 4\\) square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on \\(N\\); actually, above we have proved the base case \\(N=4\\). For the induction step, assume that \\(N>4\\), consider any \\(2^{N-2}+1\\) flags of length \\(N\\), and arrange them into a large flag of size \\(\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N\\). This flag contains a non-monochrome column since the flags are distinct; we may assume that this column is the first one. By the pigeonhole principle, this column contains at least \\(\\left\\lceil\\frac{2^{N-2}+1}{2}\\right\\rceil=2^{N-3}+1\\) squares of one color (say, blue). We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least \\(2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}\\) flags of length \\(N-1\\); by the induction hypothesis, \\(N-1\\) of them\ncan form a square \\(Q\\) with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle \\((N-1) \\times N\\), and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf \\(Q\\) has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in \\(Q\\) ). Conversely, if the diagonal of \\(Q\\) is blue then we can take any of the \\(\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0\\) remaining good flags. So, in both cases we get a desired \\(N \\times N\\) square.\n\nSolution 2. We present a different proof of the estimate \\(M_{N} \\leq 2^{N-2}+1\\). We do not use the induction, involving Hall's lemma on matchings instead.\n\nConsider arbitrary \\(2^{N-2}+1\\) distinct flags and arrange them into a large \\(\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N\\) flag. Construct two bipartite graphs \\(G_{\\mathrm{y}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\) and \\(G_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\) with the common set of vertices as follows. Let \\(V\\) and \\(V^{\\prime}\\) be the set of columns and the set of flags under consideration, respectively. Next, let the edge ( \\(c, f\\) ) appear in \\(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\) if the intersection of column \\(c\\) and flag \\(f\\) is yellow, and \\((c, f) \\in E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\) otherwise. Then we have to prove exactly that one of the graphs \\(G_{\\mathrm{y}}\\) and \\(G_{\\mathrm{b}}\\) contains a matching with all the vertices of \\(V\\) involved.\n\nAssume that these matchings do not exist. By Hall's lemma, it means that there exist two sets of columns \\(S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\subset V\\) such that \\(\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|-1\\) and \\(\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-1\\) (in the left-hand sides, \\(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\) and \\(E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\) denote respectively the sets of all vertices connected to \\(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\) and \\(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\) in the corresponding graphs). Our aim is to prove that this is impossible. Note that \\(S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq V\\) since \\(N \\leq 2^{N-2}+1\\).\n\nFirst, suppose that \\(S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq \\varnothing\\), so there exists some \\(c \\in S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\). Note that each flag is connected to \\(c\\) either in \\(G_{\\mathrm{y}}\\) or in \\(G_{\\mathrm{b}}\\), hence \\(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)=V^{\\prime}\\). Hence we have \\(2^{N-2}+1=\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|+\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|+\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-2 \\leq 2 N-4\\); this is impossible for \\(N \\geq 4\\).\n\nSo, we have \\(S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\varnothing\\). Let \\(y=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|, b=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|\\). From the construction of our graph, we have that all the flags in the set \\(V^{\\prime \\prime}=V^{\\prime} \\backslash\\left(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right)\\) have blue squares in the columns of \\(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\) and yellow squares in the columns of \\(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\). Hence the only undetermined positions in these flags are the remaining \\(N-y-b\\) ones, so \\(2^{N-y-b} \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\geq\\) \\(2^{N-2}+1-(y-1)-(b-1)\\), or, denoting \\(c=y+b, 2^{N-c}+c>2^{N-2}+2\\). This is impossible since \\(N \\geq c \\geq 2\\)."}

Divide the board into \\(2 \\times 2\\) pieces; we call these pieces blocks. Each block can contain not more than one king (otherwise these two kings would attack each other); hence, by the pigeonhole principle each block must contain exactly one king.\n\nNow assign to each block a letter T or B if a king is placed in its top or bottom half, respectively. Similarly, assign to each block a letter L or R if a king stands in its left or right half. So we define \\(T\\)-blocks, \\(B\\)-blocks, \\(L\\)-blocks, and \\(R\\)-blocks. We also combine the letters; we call a block a \\(T L\\)-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define \\(T R\\)-blocks, \\(B L\\)-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the \\(50 \\times 50\\) system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair \\((i, j)\\), where \\(1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50\\), refers to the \\(j\\) th block in the \\(i\\) th row (or the \\(i\\) th block in the \\(j\\) th column).

By ( \\(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\) ), all blocks in the \\(j\\) th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column B-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B -blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B -columns. These 25 B -columns contain 1250 B -blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain \\(25 T\\)-columns.

Therefore, \\((i+1, j)\\) cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence \\((i+1, j)\\) is a TL-block, thus the\n\\((i+1)\\) th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the \\(i\\) th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the \\(i\\) th to the 50 th are L-rows.

Problem C4 requires more invention and technical care. On the other hand, the problem statement in C 4 ' hides the fact that the resulting amount of coins can be such incredibly huge and leaves this discovery to the students."}

Hence we should have \\(A=(3,2,1,0)\\), and \\(S(T)=3^{3}+1^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-3)^{3}=0\\). On the other hand, if \\(a_{4}=1\\), then only two possibilities, \\(A=(3,1,1,1)\\) and \\(A=(2,2,1,1)\\) can take place. In the former case we have \\(S(T)=3^{3}+3 \\cdot(-2)^{3}>0\\), while in the latter one \\(S(T)=1^{3}+1^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{3}=0\\), as desired.\n\nNow we turn to the general problem. Consider a tournament \\(T\\) with no bad companies and enumerate the players by the numbers from 1 to \\(n\\). For every 4 players \\(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}\\) consider a \"sub-tournament\" \\(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\) consisting of only these players and the games which they performed with each other. By the abovementioned, we have \\(S\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right) \\geq 0\\). Our aim is to prove that\n\n\\[\nS(T)=\\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all 4 -tuples of distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\). This way the problem statement will be established.\n\nWe interpret the number \\(\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)^{3}\\) as following. For \\(i \\neq j\\), let \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}=1\\) if the \\(i\\) th player wins against the \\(j\\) th one, and \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}=-1\\) otherwise. Then\n\n\\[\n\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)^{3}=\\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\varepsilon_{i j}\\right)^{3}=\\sum_{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3} \\neq i} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}} .\n\\]\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\nS(T)=\\sum_{i \\notin\\left\\{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this expression, consider all the terms in this sum where two indices are equal. If, for instance, \\(j_{1}=j_{2}\\), then the term contains \\(\\varepsilon_{i j_{1}}^{2}=1\\), so we can replace this term by \\(\\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}\\). Make such replacements for each such term; obviously, after this change each term of the form \\(\\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}\\) will appear \\(P(T)\\) times, hence\n\n\\[\nS(T)=\\sum_{\\left|\\left\\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}\\right|=4} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}+P(T) \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\varepsilon_{i j}=S_{1}(T)+P(T) S_{2}(T)\n\\]\n\nWe show that \\(S_{2}(T)=0\\) and hence \\(S(T)=S_{1}(T)\\) for each tournament. Actually, note that \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}=-\\varepsilon_{j i}\\), and the whole sum can be split into such pairs. Since the sum in each pair is 0 , so is \\(S_{2}(T)\\).\n\nThus the desired equality (2) rewrites as\n\n\\[\nS_{1}(T)=\\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S_{1}\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, if all the numbers \\(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\) are distinct, then the set \\(\\left\\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}\\) is contained in exactly one 4 -tuple, hence the term \\(\\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}\\) appears in the right-hand part of (3) exactly once, as well as in the left-hand part. Clearly, there are no other terms in both parts, so the equality is established.\n\nSolution 2. Similarly to the first solution, we call the subsets of players as companies, and the \\(k\\)-element subsets will be called as \\(k\\)-companies.\n\nIn any company of the players, call a player the local champion of the company if he defeated all other members of the company. Similarly, if a player lost all his games against the others in the company then call him the local loser of the company. Obviously every company has at most one local champion and at most one local loser. By the condition of the problem, whenever a 4-company has a local loser, then this company has a local champion as well.\n\nSuppose that \\(k\\) is some positive integer, and let us count all cases when a player is the local champion of some \\(k\\)-company. The \\(i\\) th player won against \\(w_{i}\\) other player. To be the local champion of a \\(k\\)-company, he must be a member of the company, and the other \\(k-1\\) members must be chosen from those whom he defeated. Therefore, the \\(i\\) th player is the local champion of \\(\\binom{w_{i}}{k-1} k\\)-companies. Hence, the total number of local champions of all \\(k\\)-companies is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\binom{w_{i}}{k-1}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the total number of local losers of the \\(k\\)-companies is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{k-1}\\).\nNow apply this for \\(k=2,3\\) and 4 .\nSince every game has a winner and a loser, we have \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell_{i}=\\binom{n}{2}\\), and hence\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)=0\n\\]\n\nIn every 3-company, either the players defeated one another in a cycle or the company has both a local champion and a local loser. Therefore, the total number of local champions and local losers in the 3 -companies is the same, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\binom{w_{i}}{2}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{2}\\). So we have\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\binom{w_{i}}{2}-\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{2}\\right)=0\n\\]\n\nIn every 4-company, by the problem's condition, the number of local losers is less than or equal to the number of local champions. Then the same holds for the total numbers of local\nchampions and local losers in all 4-companies, so \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\binom{w_{i}}{3} \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{3}\\). Hence,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\binom{w_{i}}{3}-\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{3}\\right) \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nNow we establish the problem statement (1) as a linear combination of (4), (5) and (6). It is easy check that\n\n\\[\n(x-y)^{3}=24\\left(\\binom{x}{3}-\\binom{y}{3}\\right)+24\\left(\\binom{x}{2}-\\binom{y}{2}\\right)-\\left(3(x+y)^{2}-4\\right)(x-y)\n\\]\n\nApply this identity to \\(x=w_{1}\\) and \\(y=\\ell_{i}\\). Since every player played \\(n-1\\) games, we have \\(w_{i}+\\ell_{i}=n-1\\), and thus\n\n\\[\n\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)^{3}=24\\left(\\binom{w_{i}}{3}-\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{3}\\right)+24\\left(\\binom{w_{i}}{2}-\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{2}\\right)-\\left(3(n-1)^{2}-4\\right)\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)^{3}=24 \\underbrace{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\binom{w_{i}}{3}-\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{3}\\right)}_{\\geq 0}+24 \\underbrace{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\binom{w_{i}}{2}-\\binom{\\ell_{i}}{2}\\right)}_{0}-\\left(3(n-1)^{2}-4\\right) \\underbrace{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)}_{0} \\geq 0\n\\]"}

There are two strings of pearls, a string of \\(b\\) black pearls and a string of \\(w\\) white pearls. The length of a string is the number of pearls on it.\n\nOne cuts these strings in some steps by the following rules. In each step:\n(i) The strings are ordered by their lengths in a non-increasing order. If there are some strings of equal lengths, then the white ones precede the black ones. Then \\(k\\) first ones (if they consist of more than one pearl) are chosen; if there are less than \\(k\\) strings longer than 1 , then one chooses all of them.\n(ii) Next, one cuts each chosen string into two parts differing in length by at most one.\n(For instance, if there are strings of 5, 4, 4, 2 black pearls, strings of 8, 4,3 white pearls and \\(k=4\\), then the strings of 8 white, 5 black, 4 white and 4 black pearls are cut into the parts \\((4,4),(3,2),(2,2)\\) and \\((2,2)\\), respectively.)\n\nThe process stops immediately after the step when a first isolated white pearl appears. Prove that at this stage, there will still exist a string of at least two black pearls.\n(Canada)", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2010, "solution": "Denote the situation after the \\(i\\) th step by \\(A_{i}\\); hence \\(A_{0}\\) is the initial situation, and \\(A_{i-1} \\rightarrow A_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\) th step. We call a string containing \\(m\\) pearls an \\(m\\)-string; it is an \\(m\\)-w-string or a m-b-string if it is white or black, respectively.\n\nWe continue the process until every string consists of a single pearl. We will focus on three moments of the process: (a) the first stage \\(A_{s}\\) when the first 1 -string (no matter black or white) appears; (b) the first stage \\(A_{t}\\) where the total number of strings is greater than \\(k\\) (if such moment does not appear then we put \\(t=\\infty\\) ); and (c) the first stage \\(A_{f}\\) when all black pearls are isolated. It is sufficient to prove that in \\(A_{f-1}\\) (or earlier), a 1-w-string appears.\n\nWe start with some easy properties of the situations under consideration. Obviously, we have \\(s \\leq f\\). Moreover, all b-strings from \\(A_{f-1}\\) become single pearls in the \\(f\\) th step, hence all of them are 1- or 2-b-strings.\n\nNext, observe that in each step \\(A_{i} \\rightarrow A_{i+1}\\) with \\(i \\leq t-1\\), all ( \\(>1\\) )-strings were cut since there are not more than \\(k\\) strings at all; if, in addition, \\(i<s\\), then there were no 1 -string, so all the strings were cut in this step.\n\nNow, let \\(B_{i}\\) and \\(b_{i}\\) be the lengths of the longest and the shortest b-strings in \\(A_{i}\\), and let \\(W_{i}\\) and \\(w_{i}\\) be the same for \\(w\\)-strings. We show by induction on \\(i \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}\\) that (i) the situation \\(A_{i}\\) contains exactly \\(2^{i}\\) black and \\(2^{i}\\) white strings, (ii) \\(B_{i} \\geq W_{i}\\), and (iii) \\(b_{i} \\geq w_{i}\\). The base case \\(i=0\\) is obvious. For the induction step, if \\(i \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}\\) then in the \\(i\\) th step, each string is cut, thus the claim (i) follows from the induction hypothesis; next, we have \\(B_{i}=\\left\\lceil B_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rceil \\geq\\left\\lceil W_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rceil=W_{i}\\) and \\(b_{i}=\\left\\lfloor b_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rfloor \\geq\\left\\lfloor w_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rfloor=w_{i}\\), thus establishing (ii) and (iii).\n\nFor the numbers \\(s, t, f\\), two cases are possible.\nCase 1. Suppose that \\(s \\leq t\\) or \\(f \\leq t+1\\) (and hence \\(s \\leq t+1\\) ); in particular, this is true when \\(t=\\infty\\). Then in \\(A_{s-1}\\) we have \\(B_{s-1} \\geq W_{s-1}, b_{s-1} \\geq w_{s-1}>1\\) as \\(s-1 \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}\\). Now, if \\(s=f\\), then in \\(A_{s-1}\\), there is no 1 -w-string as well as no ( \\(>2\\) )-b-string. That is, \\(2=B_{s-1} \\geq W_{s-1} \\geq b_{s-1} \\geq w_{s-1}>1\\), hence all these numbers equal 2 . This means that in \\(A_{s-1}\\), all strings contain 2 pearls, and there are \\(2^{s-1}\\) black and \\(2^{s-1}\\) white strings, which means \\(b=2 \\cdot 2^{s-1}=w\\). This contradicts the problem conditions.\n\nHence we have \\(s \\leq f-1\\) and thus \\(s \\leq t\\). Therefore, in the \\(s\\) th step each string is cut into two parts. Now, if a 1 -b-string appears in this step, then from \\(w_{s-1} \\leq b_{s-1}\\) we see that a\n\n1-w-string appears as well; so, in each case in the \\(s\\) th step a 1-w-string appears, while not all black pearls become single, as desired.\n\nCase 2. Now assume that \\(t+1 \\leq s\\) and \\(t+2 \\leq f\\). Then in \\(A_{t}\\) we have exactly \\(2^{t}\\) white and \\(2^{t}\\) black strings, all being larger than 1 , and \\(2^{t+1}>k \\geq 2^{t}\\) (the latter holds since \\(2^{t}\\) is the total number of strings in \\(A_{t-1}\\) ). Now, in the ( \\(t+1\\) )st step, exactly \\(k\\) strings are cut, not more than \\(2^{t}\\) of them being black; so the number of w -strings in \\(A_{t+1}\\) is at least \\(2^{t}+\\left(k-2^{t}\\right)=k\\). Since the number of w-strings does not decrease in our process, in \\(A_{f-1}\\) we have at least \\(k\\) white strings as well.\n\nFinally, in \\(A_{f-1}\\), all b-strings are not larger than 2, and at least one 2-b-string is cut in the \\(f\\) th step. Therefore, at most \\(k-1\\) white strings are cut in this step, hence there exists a w-string \\(\\mathcal{W}\\) which is not cut in the \\(f\\) th step. On the other hand, since a 2 -b-string is cut, all \\((\\geq 2)\\)-w-strings should also be cut in the \\(f\\) th step; hence \\(\\mathcal{W}\\) should be a single pearl. This is exactly what we needed.\nComment. In this solution, we used the condition \\(b \\neq w\\) only to avoid the case \\(b=w=2^{t}\\). Hence, if a number \\(b=w\\) is not a power of 2 , then the problem statement is also valid.\n\nSolution 2. We use the same notations as introduced in the first paragraph of the previous solution. We claim that at every stage, there exist a \\(u\\)-b-string and a \\(v\\)-w-string such that either\n(i) \\(u>v \\geq 1\\), or\n(ii) \\(2 \\leq u \\leq v<2 u\\), and there also exist \\(k-1\\) of ( \\(>v / 2\\) )-strings other than considered above.\n\nFirst, we notice that this statement implies the problem statement. Actually, in both cases (i) and (ii) we have \\(u>1\\), so at each stage there exists a ( \\(\\geq 2\\) )-b-string, and for the last stage it is exactly what we need.\n\nNow, we prove the claim by induction on the number of the stage. Obviously, for \\(A_{0}\\) the condition (i) holds since \\(b>w\\). Further, we suppose that the statement holds for \\(A_{i}\\), and prove it for \\(A_{i+1}\\). Two cases are possible.\n\nCase 1. Assume that in \\(A_{i}\\), there are a \\(u\\)-b-string and a \\(v\\)-w-string with \\(u>v\\). We can assume that \\(v\\) is the length of the shortest w-string in \\(A_{i}\\); since we are not at the final stage, we have \\(v \\geq 2\\). Now, in the \\((i+1)\\) st step, two subcases may occur.\n\nSubcase 1a. Suppose that either no \\(u\\)-b-string is cut, or both some \\(u\\)-b-string and some \\(v\\)-w-string are cut. Then in \\(A_{i+1}\\), we have either a \\(u\\)-b-string and a ( \\(\\leq v\\) )-w-string (and (i) is valid), or we have a \\([u / 2]\\)-b-string and a \\(\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor-\\mathrm{w}\\)-string. In the latter case, from \\(u>v\\) we get \\(\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor\\), and (i) is valid again.\n\nSubcase 1b. Now, some \\(u\\)-b-string is cut, and no \\(v\\)-w-string is cut (and hence all the strings which are cut are longer than \\(v\\) ). If \\(u^{\\prime}=\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>v\\), then the condition (i) is satisfied since we have a \\(u^{\\prime}\\)-b-string and a \\(v\\)-w-string in \\(A_{i+1}\\). Otherwise, notice that the inequality \\(u>v \\geq 2\\) implies \\(u^{\\prime} \\geq 2\\). Furthermore, besides a fixed \\(u\\)-b-string, other \\(k-1\\) of ( \\(\\geq v+1\\) )-strings should be cut in the \\((i+1)\\) st step, hence providing at least \\(k-1\\) of \\((\\geq\\lceil(v+1) / 2\\rceil)\\)-strings, and \\(\\lceil(v+1) / 2\\rceil>v / 2\\). So, we can put \\(v^{\\prime}=v\\), and we have \\(u^{\\prime} \\leq v<u \\leq 2 u^{\\prime}\\), so the condition (ii) holds for \\(A_{i+1}\\).\n\nCase 2. Conversely, assume that in \\(A_{i}\\) there exist a \\(u\\)-b-string, a \\(v\\)-w-string \\((2 \\leq u \\leq v<2 u)\\) and a set \\(S\\) of \\(k-1\\) other strings larger than \\(v / 2\\) (and hence larger than 1 ). In the \\((i+1)\\) st step, three subcases may occur.\n\nSubcase 2a. Suppose that some \\(u\\)-b-string is not cut, and some \\(v\\)-w-string is cut. The latter one results in a \\(\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor\\)-w-string, we have \\(v^{\\prime}=\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor<u\\), and the condition (i) is valid.\n\nSubcase 2b. Next, suppose that no \\(v\\)-w-string is cut (and therefore no \\(u\\)-b-string is cut as \\(u \\leq v)\\). Then all \\(k\\) strings which are cut have the length \\(>v\\), so each one results in a ( \\(>v / 2\\) )string. Hence in \\(A_{i+1}\\), there exist \\(k \\geq k-1\\) of ( \\(>v / 2\\) )-strings other than the considered \\(u\\) - and \\(v\\)-strings, and the condition (ii) is satisfied.\n\nSubcase 2c. In the remaining case, all \\(u\\)-b-strings are cut. This means that all ( \\(\\geq u\\) )-strings are cut as well, hence our \\(v\\)-w-string is cut. Therefore in \\(A_{i+1}\\) there exists a \\(\\lceil u / 2\\rceil\\)-b-string together with a \\(\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor\\)-w-string. Now, if \\(u^{\\prime}=\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor=v^{\\prime}\\) then the condition (i) is fulfilled. Otherwise, we have \\(u^{\\prime} \\leq v^{\\prime}<u \\leq 2 u^{\\prime}\\). In this case, we show that \\(u^{\\prime} \\geq 2\\). If, to the contrary, \\(u^{\\prime}=1\\) (and hence \\(u=2\\) ), then all black and white ( \\(\\geq 2\\) )-strings should be cut in the \\((i+1)\\) st step, and among these strings there are at least a \\(u\\)-b-string, a \\(v\\)-w-string, and \\(k-1\\) strings in \\(S\\) ( \\(k+1\\) strings altogether). This is impossible.\n\nHence, we get \\(2 \\leq u^{\\prime} \\leq v^{\\prime}<2 u^{\\prime}\\). To reach (ii), it remains to check that in \\(A_{i+1}\\), there exists a set \\(S^{\\prime}\\) of \\(k-1\\) other strings larger than \\(v^{\\prime} / 2\\). These will be exactly the strings obtained from the elements of \\(S\\). Namely, each \\(s \\in S\\) was either cut in the \\((i+1)\\) st step, or not. In the former case, let us include into \\(S^{\\prime}\\) the largest of the strings obtained from \\(s\\); otherwise we include \\(s\\) itself into \\(S^{\\prime}\\). All \\(k-1\\) strings in \\(S^{\\prime}\\) are greater than \\(v / 2 \\geq v^{\\prime}\\), as desired."}

In this situation, we say that \\(L \\in U\\) corresponds to the \\(i\\) th axis, and write \\(g(L)=i\\). Since there are \\(n_{i}-1\\) vertices of the form \\(v_{i j}\\), we get that for each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell\\), not more than \\(n_{i}-1\\) subgrids correspond to the \\(i\\) th axis.\n\nFinally, we are ready to present the desired point. Since \\(W \\neq V\\), there exists a point \\(b=\\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right) \\in N \\backslash\\left(\\cup_{L \\in W} L\\right)\\). On the other hand, for every \\(1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell\\), consider any subgrid \\(L \\in U\\) with \\(g(L)=i\\). This means exactly that \\(L\\) is orthogonal to the \\(i\\) th axis, and hence all its elements have the same \\(i\\) th coordinate \\(c_{L}\\). Since there are at most \\(n_{i}-1\\) such subgrids, there exists a number \\(0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1\\) which is not contained in a set \\(\\left\\{c_{L}: g(L)=i\\right\\}\\). Choose such number for every \\(1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell\\). Now we claim that point \\(a=\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{\\ell}, b_{\\ell+1}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right)\\) is not covered, hence contradicting the Lemma condition.\n\nSurely, point \\(a\\) cannot lie in some \\(L \\in U\\), since all the points in \\(L\\) have \\(g(L)\\) th coordinate \\(c_{L} \\neq a_{g(L)}\\). On the other hand, suppose that \\(a \\in L\\) for some \\(L \\in W\\); recall that \\(b \\notin L\\). But the points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) differ only at first \\(\\ell\\) coordinates, so \\(L\\) should be orthogonal to at least one of the first \\(\\ell\\) axes, and hence our graph contains some edge ( \\(L, v_{i j}\\) ) for \\(i \\leq \\ell\\). It contradicts the definition of \\(W^{\\prime}\\). The Lemma is proved.\n\nNow we turn to the problem. Let \\(d_{j}\\) be the step of the progression \\(P_{j}\\). Note that since \\(n=\\) l.c.m. \\(\\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{s}\\right)\\), for each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\) there exists an index \\(j(i)\\) such that \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid d_{j(i)}\\). We assume that \\(n>1\\); otherwise the problem statement is trivial.\n\nFor each \\(0 \\leq m \\leq n-1\\) and \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\), let \\(m_{i}\\) be the residue of \\(m\\) modulo \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\), and let \\(m_{i}=\\overline{r_{i \\alpha_{i}} \\ldots r_{i 1}}\\) be the base \\(p_{i}\\) representation of \\(m_{i}\\) (possibly, with some leading zeroes). Now, we put into correspondence to \\(m\\) the sequence \\(r(m)=\\left(r_{11}, \\ldots, r_{1 \\alpha_{1}}, r_{21}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}\\right)\\). Hence \\(r(m)\\) lies in a \\(\\underbrace{p_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{1}}_{\\alpha_{1} \\text { times }} \\times \\cdots \\times \\underbrace{p_{k} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}}_{\\alpha_{k} \\text { times }}\\) grid \\(N\\).\n\nSurely, if \\(r(m)=r\\left(m^{\\prime}\\right)\\) then \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid m_{i}-m_{i}^{\\prime}\\), which follows \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid m-m^{\\prime}\\) for all \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\); consequently, \\(n \\mid m-m^{\\prime}\\). So, when \\(m\\) runs over the set \\(\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\), the sequences \\(r(m)\\) do not repeat; since \\(|N|=n\\), this means that \\(r\\) is a bijection between \\(\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) and \\(N\\). Now we will show that for each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq s\\), the set \\(L_{i}=\\left\\{r(m): m \\in P_{i}\\right\\}\\) is a subgrid, and that for each axis there exists a subgrid orthogonal to this axis. Obviously, these subgrids cover \\(N\\), and the condition (ii') follows directly from (ii). Hence the Lemma provides exactly the estimate we need.\n\nConsider some \\(1 \\leq j \\leq s\\) and let \\(d_{j}=p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}\\). Consider some \\(q \\in P_{j}\\) and let \\(r(q)=\\) \\(\\left(r_{11}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}\\right)\\). Then for an arbitrary \\(q^{\\prime}\\), setting \\(r\\left(q^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(r_{11}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}^{\\prime}\\right)\\) we have\n\n\\[\nq^{\\prime} \\in P_{j} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad p_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}} \\mid q-q^{\\prime} \\text { for each } 1 \\leq i \\leq k \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\\prime} \\text { for all } t \\leq \\gamma_{i}\n\\]\n\nHence \\(L_{j}=\\left\\{\\left(r_{11}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in N: r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\\prime}\\right.\\) for all \\(\\left.t \\leq \\gamma_{i}\\right\\}\\) which means that \\(L_{j}\\) is a subgrid containing \\(r(q)\\). Moreover, in \\(L_{j(i)}\\), all the coordinates corresponding to \\(p_{i}\\) are fixed, so it is orthogonal to all of their axes, as desired.\n\nComment 1. The estimate in the problem is sharp for every \\(n\\). One of the possible examples is the following one. For each \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k, 0 \\leq j \\leq \\alpha_{i}-1,1 \\leq k \\leq p-1\\), let\n\n\\[\nP_{i, j, k}=k p_{i}^{j}+p_{i}^{j+1} \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nand add the progression \\(P_{0}=n \\mathbb{Z}\\). One can easily check that this set satisfies all the problem conditions. There also exist other examples.\n\nOn the other hand, the estimate can be adjusted in the following sense. For every \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\), let \\(0=\\alpha_{i 0}, \\alpha_{i 1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i h_{i}}\\) be all the numbers of the form \\(\\operatorname{ord}_{p_{i}}\\left(d_{j}\\right)\\) in an increasing order (we delete the repeating occurences of a number, and add a number \\(0=\\alpha_{i 0}\\) if it does not occur). Then, repeating the arguments from the solution one can obtain that\n\n\\[\ns \\geq 1+\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{h_{i}}\\left(p^{\\alpha_{j}-\\alpha_{j-1}}-1\\right)\n\\]\n\nNote that \\(p^{\\alpha}-1 \\geq \\alpha(p-1)\\), and the equality is achieved only for \\(\\alpha=1\\). Hence, for reaching the minimal number of the progressions, one should have \\(\\alpha_{i, j}=j\\) for all \\(i, j\\). In other words, for each \\(1 \\leq j \\leq \\alpha_{i}\\), there should be an index \\(t\\) such that \\(\\operatorname{ord}_{p_{i}}\\left(d_{t}\\right)=j\\).\n\nSolution 2. We start with introducing some notation. For positive integer \\(r\\), we denote \\([r]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, r\\}\\). Next, we say that a set of progressions \\(\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}\\) cover \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) if each integer belongs to some of them; we say that this covering is minimal if no proper subset of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) covers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Obviously, each covering contains a minimal subcovering.\n\nNext, for a minimal covering \\(\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}\\) and for every \\(1 \\leq i \\leq s\\), let \\(d_{i}\\) be the step of progression \\(P_{i}\\), and \\(h_{i}\\) be some number which is contained in \\(P_{i}\\) but in none of the other progressions. We assume that \\(n>1\\), otherwise the problem is trivial. This implies \\(d_{i}>1\\), otherwise the progression \\(P_{i}\\) covers all the numbers, and \\(n=1\\).\n\nWe will prove a more general statement, namely the following\nClaim. Assume that the progressions \\(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\) and number \\(n=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\alpha_{k}}>1\\) are chosen as in the problem statement. Moreover, choose some nonempty set of indices \\(I=\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{t}\\right\\} \\subseteq[k]\\) and some positive integer \\(\\beta_{i} \\leq \\alpha_{i}\\) for every \\(i \\in I\\). Consider the set of indices\n\n\\[\nT=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta_{i}+1} \\mid d_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n|T| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_{i}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n\\]\n\nObserve that the Claim for \\(I=[k]\\) and \\(\\beta_{i}=\\alpha_{i}\\) implies the problem statement, since the left-hand side in (2) is not greater than \\(s\\). Hence, it suffices to prove the Claim.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item First, we prove the Claim assuming that all \\(d_{j}\\) 's are prime numbers. If for some \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\) we have at least \\(p_{i}\\) progressions with the step \\(p_{i}\\), then they do not intersect and hence cover all the integers; it means that there are no other progressions, and \\(n=p_{i}\\); the Claim is trivial in this case.\n\n\nNow assume that for every \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\), there are not more than \\(p_{i}-1\\) progressions with step \\(p_{i}\\); each such progression covers the numbers with a fixed residue modulo \\(p_{i}\\), therefore there exists a residue \\(q_{i}\\) mod \\(p_{i}\\) which is not touched by these progressions. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a number \\(q\\) such that \\(q \\equiv q_{i}\\left(\\bmod p_{i}\\right)\\) for all \\(1 \\leq i \\leq k\\); this number cannot be covered by any progression with step \\(p_{i}\\), hence it is not covered at all. A contradiction.\n2. Now, we assume that the general Claim is not valid, and hence we consider a counterexample \\(\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}\\) for the Claim; we can choose it to be minimal in the following sense:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item the number \\(n\\) is minimal possible among all the counterexamples;\n  \\item the sum \\(\\sum_{i} d_{i}\\) is minimal possible among all the counterexamples having the chosen value of \\(n\\).\n\n\nAs was mentioned above, not all numbers \\(d_{i}\\) are primes; hence we can assume that \\(d_{1}\\) is composite, say \\(p_{1} \\mid d_{1}\\) and \\(d_{1}^{\\prime}=\\frac{d_{1}}{p_{1}}>1\\). Consider a progression \\(P_{1}^{\\prime}\\) having the step \\(d_{1}^{\\prime}\\), and containing \\(P_{1}\\). We will focus on two coverings constructed as follows.\n(i) Surely, the progressions \\(P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\) cover \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), though this covering in not necessarily minimal. So, choose some minimal subcovering \\(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\) in it; surely \\(P_{1}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\) since \\(h_{1}\\) is not covered by \\(P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\), so we may assume that \\(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s^{\\prime}}\\right\\}\\) for some \\(s^{\\prime} \\leq s\\). Furthermore, the period of the covering \\(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\) can appear to be less than \\(n\\); so we denote this period by\n\n\\[\nn^{\\prime}=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}-\\sigma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\alpha_{k}-\\sigma_{k}}=\\text { l.c.m. }\\left(d_{1}^{\\prime}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{s^{\\prime}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nObserve that for each \\(P_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\), we have \\(h_{j} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}\\), otherwise \\(h_{j}\\) would not be covered by \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\n(ii) On the other hand, each nonempty set of the form \\(R_{i}=P_{i} \\cap P_{1}^{\\prime}(1 \\leq i \\leq s)\\) is also a progression with a step \\(r_{i}=\\) l.c.m. \\(\\left(d_{i}, d_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\), and such sets cover \\(P_{1}^{\\prime}\\). Scaling these progressions with the ratio \\(1 / d_{1}^{\\prime}\\), we obtain the progressions \\(Q_{i}\\) with steps \\(q_{i}=r_{i} / d_{1}^{\\prime}\\) which cover \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Now we choose a minimal subcovering \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) of this covering; again we should have \\(Q_{1} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\) by the reasons of \\(h_{1}\\). Now, denote the period of \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) by\n\n\\[\nn^{\\prime \\prime}=\\text { l.c.m. }\\left\\{q_{i}: Q_{i} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\right\\}=\\frac{\\text { l.c.m. }\\left\\{r_{i}: Q_{i} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\right\\}}{d_{1}^{\\prime}}=\\frac{p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}}{d_{1}^{\\prime}}\n\\]\n\nNote that if \\(h_{j} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}\\), then the image of \\(h_{j}\\) under the scaling can be covered by \\(Q_{j}\\) only; so, in this case we have \\(Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\).\n\nOur aim is to find the desired number of progressions in coverings \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\). First, we have \\(n \\geq n^{\\prime}\\), and the sum of the steps in \\(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\) is less than that in \\(\\mathcal{P}\\); hence the Claim is valid for \\(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\). We apply it to the set of indices \\(I^{\\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in I: \\beta_{i}>\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\) and the exponents \\(\\beta_{i}^{\\prime}=\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\); hence the set under consideration is\n\n\\[\nT^{\\prime}=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s^{\\prime}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\left(\\alpha_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)-\\beta_{i}^{\\prime}+1}=p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta_{i}+1} \\mid d_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\subseteq T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\n\\]\n\nand we obtain that\n\n\\[\n\\left|T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\\right| \\geq\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I^{\\prime}}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)=1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)_{+}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x)_{+}=\\max \\{x, 0\\}\\); the latter equality holds as for \\(i \\notin I^{\\prime}\\) we have \\(\\beta_{i} \\leq \\sigma_{i}\\).\nObserve that \\(x=(x-y)_{+}+\\min \\{x, y\\}\\) for all \\(x, y\\). So, if we find at least\n\n\\[\nG=\\sum_{i \\in I} \\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n\\]\n\nindices in \\(T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\), then we would have\n\n\\[\n|T|=\\left|T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\\right|+\\left|T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)_{+}+\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\right)\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)=1+\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_{i}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right),\n\\]\n\nthus leading to a contradiction with the choice of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). We will find those indices among the indices of progressions in \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\).\n3. Now denote \\(I^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in I: \\sigma_{i}>0\\right\\}\\) and consider some \\(i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\); then \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\nmid n^{\\prime}\\). On the other hand, there exists an index \\(j(i)\\) such that \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid d_{j(i)}\\); this means that \\(d_{j(i)} \\nmid n^{\\prime}\\) and hence \\(P_{j(i)}\\) cannot appear in \\(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\), so \\(j(i)>s^{\\prime}\\). Moreover, we have observed before that in this case \\(h_{j(i)} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}\\), hence \\(Q_{j(i)} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\). This means that \\(q_{j(i)} \\mid n^{\\prime \\prime}\\), therefore \\(\\gamma_{i}=\\alpha_{i}\\) for each \\(i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\) (recall here that \\(q_{i}=r_{i} / d_{1}^{\\prime}\\) and hence \\(\\left.d_{j(i)}\\left|r_{j(i)}\\right| d_{1}^{\\prime} n^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\).\n\nLet \\(d_{1}^{\\prime}=p_{1}^{\\tau_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\tau_{k}}\\). Then \\(n^{\\prime \\prime}=p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}-\\tau_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}}\\). Now, if \\(i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\), then for every \\(\\beta\\) the condition \\(p_{i}^{\\left(\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}\\right)-\\beta+1} \\mid q_{j}\\) is equivalent to \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta+1} \\mid r_{j}\\).\n\nNote that \\(n^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq n / d_{1}^{\\prime}<n\\), hence we can apply the Claim to the covering \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\). We perform this with the set of indices \\(I^{\\prime \\prime}\\) and the exponents \\(\\beta_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}>0\\). So, the set under consideration is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT^{\\prime \\prime} & =\\left\\{j: Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\left(\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}\\right)-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid q_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\} \n& =\\left\\{j: Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid r_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\}\n\n\\]\n\nand we obtain \\(\\left|T^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq 1+G\\). Finally, we claim that \\(T^{\\prime \\prime} \\subseteq T \\cap\\left(\\{1\\} \\cup\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right)\\); then we will obtain \\(\\left|T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right| \\geq G\\), which is exactly what we need.\n\nTo prove this, consider any \\(j \\in T^{\\prime \\prime}\\). Observe first that \\(\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1>\\alpha_{i}-\\sigma_{i} \\geq \\tau_{i}\\), hence from \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid r_{j}=\\) l.c.m. \\(\\left(d_{1}^{\\prime}, d_{j}\\right)\\) we have \\(p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid d_{j}\\), which means that \\(j \\in T\\). Next, the exponent of \\(p_{i}\\) in \\(d_{j}\\) is greater than that in \\(n^{\\prime}\\), which means that \\(P_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\). This may appear only if \\(j=1\\) or \\(j>s^{\\prime}\\), as desired. This completes the proof.\nComment 2. A grid analogue of the Claim is also valid. It reads as following.\nClaim. Assume that the grid \\(N\\) is covered by subgrids \\(L_{1}, L_{2}, \\ldots, L_{s}\\) so that\n(ii') each subgrid contains a point which is not covered by other subgrids;\n(iii) for each coordinate axis, there exists a subgrid \\(L_{i}\\) orthogonal to this axis.\n\nChoose some set of indices \\(I=\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{t}\\right\\} \\subset[k]\\), and consider the set of indices\n\n\\[\nT=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s, \\text { and } L_{j} \\text { is orthogonal to the } i \\text { th axis for some } i \\in I\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n|T| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(n_{i}-1\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis Claim may be proved almost in the same way as in Solution 1."}

Now, if we have \\(X Y=X M+Y M>2 r \\cot \\alpha\\), then surely \\(X M>Y M\\).\n\nOn the other hand, this additional condition follows easily from the conditions of the original problem.

Lemma 2(b) (together with the easy Lemma 1(b)) is the key tool in this solution. If one finds this fact, then the solution can be finished in many ways. That is, one can find a circle touching three of \\(h_{2}, h_{3}, \\gamma_{2}\\), and \\(\\gamma_{3}\\), and then prove that it is tangent to the fourth one in either synthetic or analytical way. Both approaches can be successful.\n\nHere we present some discussion about this key Lemma.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item In the solution above we chose an analytic proof for Lemma 2(b) because we expect that most students will use coordinates or vectors to examine the locus of the centers, and these approaches are less case-sensitive.\n\n\nHere we outline a synthetic proof. We consider only the case when \\(P\\) does not lie in the line \\(O_{i} O_{j}\\). The other case can be obtained as a limit case, or computed in a direct way.\n\nLet \\(S\\) be the internal homothety center between the circles of \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{j}\\), lying on \\(O_{i} O_{j}\\); this point does not depend on \\(P\\). Let \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) be the points of tangency of circle \\(\\sigma=\\Omega(P, r)\\) with \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{j}\\), respectively (then \\(r=P U=P V\\) ); in other words, points \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are the intersection points of rays \\(O_{i} P, O_{j} P\\) with arcs \\(\\gamma_{i}, \\gamma_{j}\\) respectively (see Fig. 4).\n\nDue to the theorem on three homothety centers (or just to the Menelaus theorem applied to triangle \\(O_{i} O_{j} P\\) ), the points \\(U, V\\) and \\(S\\) are collinear. Let \\(T\\) be the intersection point of line \\(A C\\) and the common tangent to \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) at \\(U\\); then \\(T\\) is the radical center of \\(\\sigma, \\gamma_{i}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{j}\\), hence \\(T V\\) is the common tangent to \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\gamma_{j}\\).\n\nLet \\(Q\\) be the projection of \\(P\\) onto the line \\(A C\\). By the right angles, the points \\(U, V\\) and \\(Q\\) lie on the circle with diameter \\(P T\\). From this fact and the equality \\(P U=P V\\) we get \\(\\angle U Q P=\\angle U V P=\\) \\(\\angle V U P=\\angle S U O_{i}\\). Since \\(O_{i} S \\| P Q\\), we have \\(\\angle S O_{i} U=\\angle Q P U\\). Hence, the triangles \\(S O_{i} U\\) and \\(U P Q\\) are similar and thus \\(\\frac{r}{d(P)}=\\frac{P U}{P Q}=\\frac{O_{i} S}{O_{i} U}=\\frac{O_{i} S}{R_{i}}\\); the last expression is constant since \\(S\\) is a constant point.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-63(1)}\n\nFig. 4\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-63}\n\nFig. 5\n2. Using some known facts about conics, the same statement can be proved in a very short way. Denote by \\(\\ell\\) the directrix of ellipse of \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}\\) related to the focus \\(O_{j}\\); since \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}\\) is symmetrical about \\(O_{i} O_{j}\\), we have \\(\\ell \\| A C\\). Recall that for each point \\(P \\in \\varepsilon_{i j}\\), we have \\(P O_{j}=\\epsilon \\cdot d_{\\ell}(P)\\), where \\(d_{\\ell}(P)\\) is the distance from \\(P\\) to \\(\\ell\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the eccentricity of \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}\\) (see Fig. 5).\n\nNow we have\n\n\\[\nr=R_{j}-\\left(R_{j}-r\\right)=A O_{j}-P O_{j}=\\epsilon\\left(d_{\\ell}(A)-d_{\\ell}(P)\\right)=\\epsilon(d(P)-d(A))=\\epsilon \\cdot d(P)\n\\]\n\nand \\(\\epsilon\\) does not depend on \\(P\\).\n\nComment 2. One can find a spatial interpretations of the problem and the solution.\nFor every point ( \\(x, y\\) ) and radius \\(r>0\\), represent the circle \\(\\Omega((x, y), r)\\) by the point ( \\(x, y, r\\) ) in space. This point is the apex of the cone with base circle \\(\\Omega((x, y), r)\\) and height \\(r\\). According to Lemma 1, the circles which are tangent to \\(h_{i}\\) and \\(h_{j}\\) correspond to the points of a half line \\(\\beta_{i j}^{\\prime}\\), starting at \\(B\\).\n\nNow we translate Lemma 2. Take some \\(1 \\leq i<j \\leq 3\\), and consider those circles which are internally tangent to \\(\\gamma_{j}\\). It is easy to see that the locus of the points which represent these circles is a subset of a cone, containing \\(\\gamma_{j}\\). Similarly, the circles which are externally tangent to \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) correspond to the points on the extension of another cone, which has its apex on the opposite side of the base plane \\(\\Pi\\). (See Fig. 6; for this illustration, the \\(z\\)-coordinates were multiplied by 2.)\n\nThe two cones are symmetric to each other (they have the same aperture, and their axes are parallel). As is well-known, it follows that the common points of the two cones are co-planar. So the intersection of the two cones is a conic section - which is an ellipse, according to Lemma 2(a). The points which represent the circles touching \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{j}\\) is an ellipse arc \\(\\varepsilon_{i j}^{\\prime}\\) with end-points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-64(1)}\n\nFig. 6\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_d27755b953882b2aeed4g-64}\n\nFig. 7\n\nThus, the curved quadrilateral \\(\\mathcal{Q}_{i j}\\) is circumscribed if and only if \\(\\beta_{i, i+1}^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{j, j+1}^{\\prime}\\) intersect, i.e. if they are coplanar.

This implies \\(m^{\\prime} \\equiv k^{\\prime}(\\bmod 2010)\\) as \\((a, b)\\) is 2010-good. It follows that \\(m \\equiv m^{\\prime} \\equiv k^{\\prime} \\equiv k(\\bmod 67)\\). Therefore, \\((a, b)\\) is 67 -good.\nClaim 2. If \\((a, b)\\) is 67 -good then \\(67 \\mid a\\).\nProof. Suppose that \\(67 \\nmid a\\). Consider the sets \\(\\left\\{a t^{2}(\\bmod 67): 0 \\leq t \\leq 33\\right\\}\\) and \\(\\left\\{-3 a s^{2}-b\\right.\\) \\(\\bmod 67: 0 \\leq s \\leq 33\\}\\). Since \\(a \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)\\), each of these sets has 34 elements. Hence they have at least one element in common. If \\(a t^{2} \\equiv-3 a s^{2}-b(\\bmod 67)\\) then for \\(m=t \\pm s, k=\\mp 2 s\\) we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(m)-P(k)=a\\left(m^{3}-k^{3}\\right)+b(m-k) & =(m-k)\\left(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\right) \n& =(t \\pm 3 s)\\left(a t^{2}+3 a s^{2}+b\\right) \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 67)\n\n\\]\n\nSince \\((a, b)\\) is 67 -good, we must have \\(m \\equiv k(\\bmod 67)\\) in both cases, that is, \\(t \\equiv 3 s(\\bmod 67)\\) and \\(t \\equiv-3 s(\\bmod 67)\\). This means \\(t \\equiv s \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)\\) and \\(b \\equiv-3 a s^{2}-a t^{2} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)\\). But then \\(67 \\mid P(7)-P(2)=67 \\cdot 5 a+5 b\\) and \\(67 \\nmid 7-2\\), contradicting that \\((a, b)\\) is 67 -good.\nClaim 3. If \\((a, b)\\) is 2010 -good then \\((a, b)\\) is \\(67^{i}\\)-good all \\(i \\geq 1\\).\nProof. By Claim 2, we have \\(67 \\mid a\\). If \\(67 \\mid b\\), then \\(P(x) \\equiv P(0)(\\bmod 67)\\) for all \\(x\\), contradicting that \\((a, b)\\) is 67 -good. Hence, \\(67 \\nmid b\\).\n\nSuppose that \\(67^{i} \\mid P(m)-P(k)=(m-k)\\left(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\right)\\). Since \\(67 \\mid a\\) and \\(67 \\nmid b\\), the second factor \\(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\) is coprime to 67 and hence \\(67^{i} \\mid m-k\\). Therefore, \\((a, b)\\) is \\(67^{i}\\)-good.\nComment 1. In the proof of Claim 2, the following reasoning can also be used. Since 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 67 , either \\(a u^{2} \\equiv-b(\\bmod 67)\\) or \\(3 a v^{2} \\equiv-b(\\bmod 67)\\) has a solution. The settings \\((m, k)=(u, 0)\\) in the first case and \\((m, k)=(v,-2 v)\\) in the second case lead to \\(b \\equiv 0\\) (mod 67).\nComment 2. The pair (67,30) is \\(n\\)-good if and only if \\(n=d \\cdot 67^{i}\\), where \\(d \\mid 30\\) and \\(i \\geq 0\\). It shows that in part (b), one should deal with the large powers of 67 to reach the solution. The key property of number 67 is that it has the form \\(3 k+1\\), so there exists a nontrivial cubic root of unity modulo 67 ."}

We start with the following Lemma. Suppose that \\(p \\mid f(k)-f(\\ell)\\) for some prime \\(p\\) and positive integers \\(k, \\ell\\). Then \\(p \\mid k-\\ell\\). Proof. Suppose first that \\(p^{2} \\mid f(k)-f(\\ell)\\), so \\(f(\\ell)=f(k)+p^{2} a\\) for some integer \\(a\\). Take some positive integer \\(D>\\max \\{f(k), f(\\ell)\\}\\) which is not divisible by \\(p\\) and set \\(n=p D-f(k)\\).

Now, applying the problem conditions, we get that both the numbers \\((f(k)+n)(f(n)+k)\\) and \\((f(\\ell)+n)(f(n)+\\ell)\\) are squares divisible by \\(p\\) (and thus by \\(p^{2}\\) ); this means that the multipliers \\(f(n)+k\\) and \\(f(n)+\\ell\\) are also divisible by \\(p\\), therefore \\(p \\mid(f(n)+k)-(f(n)+\\ell)=k-\\ell\\) as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if \\(f(k)-f(\\ell)\\) is divisible by \\(p\\) but not by \\(p^{2}\\), then choose the same number \\(D\\) and set \\(n=p^{3} D-f(k)\\). Then the positive numbers \\(f(k)+n=p^{3} D\\) and \\(f(\\ell)+n=\\) \\(p^{3} D+(f(\\ell)-f(k))\\) are respectively divisible by \\(p^{3}\\) (but not by \\(p^{4}\\) ) and by \\(p\\) (but not by \\(p^{2}\\) ). Hence in analogous way we obtain that the numbers \\(f(n)+k\\) and \\(f(n)+\\ell\\) are divisible by \\(p\\), therefore \\(p \\mid(f(n)+k)-(f(n)+\\ell)=k-\\ell\\).\n\nWe turn to the problem. First, suppose that \\(f(k)=f(\\ell)\\) for some \\(k, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then by Lemma we have that \\(k-\\ell\\) is divisible by every prime number, so \\(k-\\ell=0\\), or \\(k=\\ell\\). Therefore, the function \\(f\\) is injective.\n\nNext, consider the numbers \\(f(k)\\) and \\(f(k+1)\\). Since the number \\((k+1)-k=1\\) has no prime divisors, by Lemma the same holds for \\(f(k+1)-f(k)\\); thus \\(|f(k+1)-f(k)|=1\\).\n\nNow, let \\(f(2)-f(1)=q,|q|=1\\). Then we prove by induction that \\(f(n)=f(1)+q(n-1)\\). The base for \\(n=1,2\\) holds by the definition of \\(q\\).

Then \\(q\\) cannot be -1 since otherwise for \\(n \\geq f(1)+1\\) we have \\(f(n) \\leq 0\\) which is impossible.

Hence the sum is not divisible even by \\(2^{m-1}\\). A contradiction.\n\nNow, for every pair of integers \\((a, b) \\neq(0,0)\\), let \\(\\mu(a, b)=\\min \\{\\nu(a), \\nu(b)\\}\\). By an obvious induction, for every Fibonacci-type sequence \\(A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)\\) we have \\(\\mu\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}\\right)=\\mu\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\\right)=\\ldots\\); denote this common value by \\(\\mu(A)\\). Also denote by \\(p_{n}(A)\\) the period of this sequence modulo \\(2^{n}\\), that is, the least \\(p>0\\) such that \\(a_{k+p} \\equiv a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) for all \\(k \\geq 0\\).\nLemma 3. Let \\(A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)\\) be a Fibonacci-type sequence such that \\(\\mu(A)=k<n\\). Then \\(p_{n}(A)=3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}\\).\nProof. First, we note that the sequence ( \\(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\) ) has period \\(p\\) modulo \\(2^{n}\\) if and only if the sequence \\(\\left(a_{0} / 2^{k}, a_{1} / 2^{k}, \\ldots\\right)\\) has period \\(p\\) modulo \\(2^{n-k}\\). Hence, passing to this sequence we can assume that \\(k=0\\).\n\nWe prove the statement by induction on \\(n\\). It is easy to see that for \\(n=1,2\\) the claim is true; actually, each Fibonacci-type sequence \\(A\\) with \\(\\mu(A)=0\\) behaves as \\(0,1,1,0,1,1, \\ldots\\) modulo 2 , and as \\(0,1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1, \\ldots\\) modulo 4 (all pairs of residues from which at least one is odd appear as a pair of consecutive terms in this sequence).\n\nNow suppose that \\(n \\geq 3\\) and consider an arbitrary Fibonacci-type sequence \\(A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)\\) with \\(\\mu(A)=0\\). Obviously we should have \\(p_{n-1}(A) \\mid p_{n}(A)\\), or, using the induction hypothesis, \\(s=3 \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\mid p_{n}(A)\\). Next, we may suppose that \\(a_{0}\\) is even; hence \\(a_{1}\\) is odd, and \\(a_{0}=2 b_{0}\\), \\(a_{1}=2 b_{1}+1\\) for some integers \\(b_{0}, b_{1}\\).\n\nConsider the Fibonacci-type sequence \\(B=\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots\\right)\\) starting with ( \\(b_{0}, b_{1}\\) ). Since \\(a_{0}=\\) \\(2 b_{0}+F_{0}, a_{1}=2 b_{1}+F_{1}\\), by an easy induction we get \\(a_{k}=2 b_{k}+F_{k}\\) for all \\(k \\geq 0\\). By the induction hypothesis, we have \\(p_{n-1}(B) \\mid s\\), hence the sequence \\(\\left(2 b_{0}, 2 b_{1}, \\ldots\\right)\\) is \\(s\\)-periodic modulo \\(2^{n}\\). On the other hand, by Lemma 2 we have \\(F_{s+1} \\equiv 1+2^{n-1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), F_{2 s} \\equiv 0\\) \\(\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), F_{2 s+1} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\), hence\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\na_{s+1}=2 b_{s+1}+F_{s+1} \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1+2^{n-1} \\not \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \na_{2 s}=2 b_{2 s}+F_{2 s} \\equiv 2 b_{0}+0=a_{0} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \na_{2 s+1}=2 b_{2 s+1}+F_{2 s+1} \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nThe first line means that \\(A\\) is not \\(s\\)-periodic, while the other two provide that \\(a_{2 s} \\equiv a_{0}\\), \\(a_{2 s+1} \\equiv a_{1}\\) and hence \\(a_{2 s+t} \\equiv a_{t}\\) for all \\(t \\geq 0\\). Hence \\(s\\left|p_{n}(A)\\right| 2 s\\) and \\(p_{n}(A) \\neq s\\), which means that \\(p_{n}(A)=2 s\\), as desired.\n\nFinally, Lemma 3 provides a straightforward method of counting the number of cycles. Actually, take any number \\(0 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\) and consider all the cells \\((i, j)\\) with \\(\\mu(i, j)=k\\). The total number of such cells is \\(2^{2(n-k)}-2^{2(n-k-1)}=3 \\cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}\\). On the other hand, they are split into cycles, and by Lemma 3 the length of each cycle is \\(3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}\\). Hence the number of cycles consisting of these cells is exactly \\(\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}}{3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}=2^{n-k-1}\\). Finally, there is only one cell \\((0,0)\\) which is not mentioned in the previous computation, and it forms a separate cycle. So the total number of cycles is\n\n\\[\n1+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^{n-1-k}=1+\\left(1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{n-1}\\right)=2^{n}\n\\]\n\nComment. We outline a different proof for the essential part of Lemma 3. That is, we assume that \\(k=0\\) and show that in this case the period of \\(\\left(a_{i}\\right)\\) modulo \\(2^{n}\\) coincides with the period of the Fibonacci numbers modulo \\(2^{n}\\); then the proof can be finished by the arguments from Lemma 2..\n\nNote that \\(p\\) is a (not necessarily minimal) period of the sequence ( \\(a_{i}\\) ) modulo \\(2^{n}\\) if and only if we have \\(a_{0} \\equiv a_{p}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), a_{1} \\equiv a_{p+1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\), that is,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{0} \\equiv a_{p} \\equiv F_{p-1} a_{0}+F_{p} a_{1}=F_{p}\\left(a_{1}-a_{0}\\right)+F_{p+1} a_{0} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \n& a_{1} \\equiv a_{p+1}=F_{p} a_{0}+F_{p+1} a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nNow, If \\(p\\) is a period of \\(\\left(F_{i}\\right)\\) then we have \\(F_{p} \\equiv F_{0}=0\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) and \\(F_{p+1} \\equiv F_{1}=1\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\), which by (1) implies that \\(p\\) is a period of \\(\\left(a_{i}\\right)\\) as well.\n\nConversely, suppose that \\(p\\) is a period of \\(\\left(a_{i}\\right)\\). Combining the relations of (1) we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0=a_{1} \\cdot a_{0}-a_{0} \\cdot a_{1} & \\equiv a_{1}\\left(F_{p}\\left(a_{1}-a_{0}\\right)+F_{p+1} a_{0}\\right)-a_{0}\\left(F_{p} a_{0}+F_{p+1} a_{1}\\right) \n& =F_{p}\\left(a_{1}^{2}-a_{1} a_{0}-a_{0}^{2}\\right) \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \na_{1}^{2}-a_{1} a_{0}-a_{0}^{2}=\\left(a_{1}-a_{0}\\right) a_{1}-a_{0} \\cdot a_{0} & \\equiv\\left(a_{1}-a_{0}\\right)\\left(F_{p} a_{0}+F_{p+1} a_{1}\\right)-a_{0}\\left(F_{p}\\left(a_{1}-a_{0}\\right)+F_{p+1} a_{0}\\right) \n& =F_{p+1}\\left(a_{1}^{2}-a_{1} a_{0}-a_{0}^{2}\\right) \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nSince at least one of the numbers \\(a_{0}, a_{1}\\) is odd, the number \\(a_{1}^{2}-a_{1} a_{0}-a_{0}^{2}\\) is odd as well. Therefore the previous relations are equivalent with \\(F_{p} \\equiv 0\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) and \\(F_{p+1} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\), which means exactly that \\(p\\) is a period of ( \\(F_{0}, F_{1}, \\ldots\\) ) modulo \\(2^{n}\\).\n\nSo, the sets of periods of \\(\\left(a_{i}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(F_{i}\\right)\\) coincide, and hence the minimal periods coincide as well."}

So \\(f\\) is periodic with period \\(r\\), i. e.\n\n\\[\nf(a+r)=f(a) \\quad \\text { for all } a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nIn particular, if \\(f(1)=0\\) then \\(f\\) is constant, thus \\(f(a)=0\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). This function clearly satisfies the functional equation. For the rest of the analysis, we assume \\(f(1)=k \\neq 0\\).\n\nBy (3) we have \\(f(2)=0\\) or \\(f(2)=4 k\\). If \\(f(2)=0\\) then \\(f\\) is periodic of period 2 , thus \\(f(\\) even \\()=0\\) and \\(f\\) (odd) \\(=k\\). This function is a solution for every \\(k\\). We postpone the verification; for the sequel assume \\(f(2)=4 k \\neq 0\\).\n\nBy (3) again, we have \\(f(4)=0\\) or \\(f(4)=16 k\\). In the first case \\(f\\) is periodic of period 4, and \\(f(3)=f(-1)=f(1)=k\\), so we have \\(f(4 n)=0, f(4 n+1)=f(4 n+3)=k\\), and \\(f(4 n+2)=4 k\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). This function is a solution too, which we justify later. For the rest of the analysis, we assume \\(f(4)=16 k \\neq 0\\).\n\nWe show now that \\(f(3)=9 k\\). In order to do so, we need two substitutions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a=1, b=2, c=-3 \\Longrightarrow f(3)^{2}-10 k f(3)+9 k^{2}=0 \n& a=1, b=3, c=-4 \\Longrightarrow f(3)^{2}-34 k f(3)+225 k^{2}=0 \\Longrightarrow f(3) \\in\\{k, 9 k\\} \n&a=13) \\in\\{9 k, 25 k\\}\n\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(f(3)=9 k\\), as claimed. Now we prove inductively that the only remaining function is \\(f(x)=k x^{2}, x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). We proved this for \\(x=0,1,2,3,4\\). Assume that \\(n \\geq 4\\) and that \\(f(x)=k x^{2}\\) holds for all integers \\(x \\in[0, n]\\). Then the substitutions \\(a=n, b=1, c=-n-1\\) and \\(a=n-1\\), \\(b=2, c=-n-1\\) lead respectively to\n\n\\[\nf(n+1) \\in\\left\\{k(n+1)^{2}, k(n-1)^{2}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(n+1) \\in\\left\\{k(n+1)^{2}, k(n-3)^{2}\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(k(n-1)^{2} \\neq k(n-3)^{2}\\) for \\(n \\neq 2\\), the only possibility is \\(f(n+1)=k(n+1)^{2}\\). This completes the induction, so \\(f(x)=k x^{2}\\) for all \\(x \\geq 0\\). The same expression is valid for negative values of \\(x\\) since \\(f\\) is even. To verify that \\(f(x)=k x^{2}\\) is actually a solution, we need to check the identity \\(a^{4}+b^{4}+(a+b)^{4}=2 a^{2} b^{2}+2 a^{2}(a+b)^{2}+2 b^{2}(a+b)^{2}\\), which follows directly by expanding both sides.\n\nTherefore the only possible solutions of the functional equation are the constant function \\(f_{1}(x)=0\\) and the following functions:\n\n\\[\nf_{2}(x)=k x^{2} \\quad f_{3}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & x \\text { even } \nk & x \\text { odd }\n \\quad f_{4}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & x \\equiv 0 & (\\bmod 4) \nk & x \\equiv 1 & (\\bmod 2) \n4 k & x \\equiv 2 & (\\bmod 4)\n\\right.\\right.\n\\]\n\nfor any non-zero integer \\(k\\). The verification that they are indeed solutions was done for the first two. For \\(f_{3}\\) note that if \\(a+b+c=0\\) then either \\(a, b, c\\) are all even, in which case \\(f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=0\\), or one of them is even and the other two are odd, so both sides of the equation equal \\(2 k^{2}\\). For \\(f_{4}\\) we use similar parity considerations and the symmetry of the equation, which reduces the verification to the triples \\((0, k, k),(4 k, k, k),(0,0,0),(0,4 k, 4 k)\\). They all satisfy the equation.\n\nComment. We used several times the same fact: For any \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) the functional equation is a quadratic equation in \\(f(a+b)\\) whose coefficients depend on \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\) :\n\n\\[\nf(a+b)^{2}-2(f(a)+f(b)) f(a+b)+(f(a)-f(b))^{2}=0\n\\]\n\nIts discriminant is \\(16 f(a) f(b)\\). Since this value has to be non-negative for any \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), we conclude that either \\(f\\) or \\(-f\\) is always non-negative. Also, if \\(f\\) is a solution of the functional equation, then \\(-f\\) is also a solution. Therefore we can assume \\(f(x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Now, the two solutions of the quadratic equation are\n\n\\[\nf(a+b) \\in\\left\\{(\\sqrt{f(a)}+\\sqrt{f(b)})^{2},(\\sqrt{f(a)}-\\sqrt{f(b)})^{2}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { for all } a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nThe computation of \\(f(3)\\) from \\(f(1), f(2)\\) and \\(f(4)\\) that we did above follows immediately by setting \\((a, b)=(1,2)\\) and \\((a, b)=(1,-4)\\). The inductive step, where \\(f(n+1)\\) is derived from \\(f(n), f(n-1)\\), \\(f(2)\\) and \\(f(1)\\), follows immediately using \\((a, b)=(n, 1)\\) and \\((a, b)=(n-1,2)\\)."}

On the other hand \\(A=\\{0\\}+A \\subset A+A\\), implying \\(A=A+A=B+C\\).\n\nTherefore \\(A+B+C=A+A+A=A\\), and now \\(B+B=C+A\\) and \\(C+C=A+B\\) yield \\(B+B+B=A+B+C=A, C+C+C=A+B+C=A\\). In particular if \\(r \\in \\mathbb{Q}=A \\cup B \\cup C\\) is arbitrary then \\(3 r \\in A\\).\n\nHowever such a conclusion is impossible. Take any \\(b \\in B(B \\neq \\emptyset)\\) and let \\(r=b / 3 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Then \\(b=3 r \\in A\\) which is a contradiction.\n\nSolution 2. We prove that the example for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) from the first solution is unique, and then use this fact to solve part b).\n\nLet \\(\\mathbb{Z}=A \\cup B \\cup C\\) be a partition of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(A, B, C \\neq \\emptyset\\) and \\(A+B, B+C, C+A\\) disjoint. We need the relations (1) which clearly hold for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Fix two consecutive integers from different sets, say \\(b \\in B\\) and \\(c=b+1 \\in C\\). For every \\(a \\in A\\) we have, in view of (1), \\(a-1=a+b-c \\in C\\) and \\(a+1=a+c-b \\in B\\). So every \\(a \\in A\\) is preceded by a number from \\(C\\) and followed by a number from \\(B\\).\n\nIn particular there are pairs of the form \\(c, c+1\\) with \\(c \\in C, c+1 \\in A\\). For such a pair and any \\(b \\in B\\) analogous reasoning shows that each \\(b \\in B\\) is preceded by a number from \\(A\\) and followed by a number from \\(C\\). There are also pairs \\(b, b-1\\) with \\(b \\in B, b-1 \\in A\\). We use them in a similar way to prove that each \\(c \\in C\\) is preceded by a number from \\(B\\) and followed by a number from \\(A\\).\n\nBy putting the observations together we infer that \\(A, B, C\\) are the three congruence classes modulo 3. Observe that all multiples of 3 are in the set of the partition that contains 0 .\n\nNow we turn to part b). Suppose that there is a partition of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) with the given properties. Choose three rationals \\(r_{i}=p_{i} / q_{i}\\) from the three sets \\(A, B, C, i=1,2,3\\), and set \\(N=3 q_{1} q_{2} q_{3}\\).\n\nLet \\(S \\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\) be the set of fractions with denominators \\(N\\) (irreducible or not). It is obtained through multiplication of every integer by the constant \\(1 / N\\), hence closed under sums and differences. Moreover, if we identify each \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(k / N \\in S\\) then \\(S\\) is essentially the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) with respect to addition. The numbers \\(r_{i}\\) belong to \\(S\\) because\n\n\\[\nr_{1}=\\frac{3 p_{1} q_{2} q_{3}}{N}, \\quad r_{2}=\\frac{3 p_{2} q_{3} q_{1}}{N}, \\quad r_{3}=\\frac{3 p_{3} q_{1} q_{2}}{N}\n\\]\n\nThe partition \\(\\mathbb{Q}=A \\cup B \\cup C\\) of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) induces a partition \\(S=A^{\\prime} \\cup B^{\\prime} \\cup C^{\\prime}\\) of \\(S\\), with \\(A^{\\prime}=A \\cap S\\), \\(B^{\\prime}=B \\cap S, C^{\\prime}=C \\cap S\\). Clearly \\(A^{\\prime}+B^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}+C^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}+A^{\\prime}\\) are disjoint, so this partition has the properties we consider.\n\nBy the uniqueness of the example for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) the sets \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}\\) are the congruence classes modulo 3 , multiplied by \\(1 / N\\). Also all multiples of \\(3 / N\\) are in the same set, \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}\\) or \\(C^{\\prime}\\). This holds for \\(r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\) in particular as they are all multiples of \\(3 / N\\). However \\(r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}\\) are in different sets \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}\\) since they were chosen from different sets \\(A, B, C\\). The contradiction ends the proof.\n\nComment. The uniqueness of the example for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) can also be deduced from the argument in the first solution."}

In other words one can assume that \\(f\\) is monic. Then the leading coefficient of \\(p f+g\\) is \\(p\\), and if \\(r=u / v\\) is a rational root of \\(p f+g\\) with \\((u, v)=1\\) and \\(v>0\\), then either \\(v=1\\) or \\(v=p\\).\n\nFirst consider the case when \\(v=1\\) infinitely many times. If \\(v=1\\) then \\(|u| \\leq R\\), so there are only finitely many possibilities for the integer \\(u\\). Therefore there exist distinct primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) for which we have the same value of \\(u\\). Then the polynomials \\(p f+g\\) and \\(q f+g\\) share this root, implying \\(f(u)=g(u)=0\\). So in this case \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) have an integer root in common.\n\nNow suppose that \\(v=p\\) infinitely many times. By comparing the exponent of \\(p\\) in the denominators of \\(p f(u / p)\\) and \\(g(u / p)\\) we get \\(m=n-1\\) and \\(p f(u / p)+g(u / p)=0\\) reduces to an equation of the form\n\n\\[\n\\left(u^{n}+a_{n-1} p u^{n-1}+\\ldots+a_{0} p^{n}\\right)+\\left(b_{n-1} u^{n-1}+b_{n-2} p u^{n-2}+\\ldots+b_{0} p^{n-1}\\right)=0\n\\]\n\nThe equation above implies that \\(u^{n}+b_{n-1} u^{n-1}\\) is divisible by \\(p\\) and hence, since \\((u, p)=1\\), we have \\(u+b_{n-1}=p k\\) with some integer \\(k\\).

Hence there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that the number \\(\\frac{p k-b_{n-1}}{p}=k-\\frac{b_{n-1}}{p}\\) is a root of \\(p f+g\\) for infinitely many primes \\(p\\).

Thus the integer \\(k\\) is a root of \\(f\\).\n\nIn summary the monic polynomial \\(f\\) obtained after the initial reduction always has an integer root. Therefore the original polynomial \\(f\\) has a rational root.\n\nSolution 2. Analogously to the first solution, there exists a real number \\(R\\) such that the complex roots of all polynomials of the form \\(p f+g\\) lie in the disk \\(|z| \\leq R\\).\n\nFor each prime \\(p\\) such that \\(p f+g\\) has a rational root, by Gauss' lemma \\(p f+g\\) is the product of two integer polynomials, one with degree 1 and the other with degree \\(\\operatorname{deg} f-1\\). Since \\(p\\) is a prime, the leading coefficient of one of these factors divides the leading coefficient of \\(f\\). Denote that factor by \\(h_{p}\\).\n\nBy narrowing the set of the primes used we can assume that all polynomials \\(h_{p}\\) have the same degree and the same leading coefficient. Their complex roots lie in the disk \\(|z| \\leq R\\), hence Vieta's formulae imply that all coefficients of all polynomials \\(h_{p}\\) form a bounded set. Since these coefficients are integers, there are only finitely many possible polynomials \\(h_{p}\\). Hence there is a polynomial \\(h\\) such that \\(h_{p}=h\\) for infinitely many primes \\(p\\).\n\nFinally, if \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes with \\(h_{p}=h_{q}=h\\) then \\(h\\) divides \\((p-q) f\\). Since \\(\\operatorname{deg} h=1\\) or \\(\\operatorname{deg} h=\\operatorname{deg} f-1\\), in both cases \\(f\\) has a rational root.\n\nComment. Clearly the polynomial \\(h\\) is a common factor of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). If \\(\\operatorname{deg} h=1\\) then \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) share a rational root. Otherwise \\(\\operatorname{deg} h=\\operatorname{deg} f-1\\) forces \\(\\operatorname{deg} g=\\operatorname{deg} f-1\\) and \\(g\\) divides \\(f\\) over the rationals.\nSolution 3. Like in the first solution, there is a real number \\(R\\) such that the real roots of all polynomials of the form \\(p f+g\\) lie in the interval \\([-R, R]\\).\n\nLet \\(p_{1}<p_{2}<\\cdots\\) be an infinite sequence of primes so that for every index \\(k\\) the polynomial \\(p_{k} f+g\\) has a rational root \\(r_{k}\\). The sequence \\(r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots\\) is bounded, so it has a convergent subsequence \\(r_{k_{1}}, r_{k_{2}}, \\ldots\\) Now replace the sequences \\(\\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(p_{k_{1}}, p_{k_{2}}, \\ldots\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(r_{k_{1}}, r_{k_{2}}, \\ldots\\right)\\); after this we can assume that the sequence \\(r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots\\) is convergent. Let \\(\\alpha=\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} r_{k}\\). We show that \\(\\alpha\\) is a rational root of \\(f\\).\n\nOver the interval \\([-R, R]\\), the polynomial \\(g\\) is bounded, \\(|g(x)| \\leq M\\) with some fixed \\(M\\). Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\left|f\\left(r_{k}\\right)\\right|=\\left|f\\left(r_{k}\\right)-\\frac{p_{k} f\\left(r_{k}\\right)+g\\left(r_{k}\\right)}{p_{k}}\\right|=\\frac{\\left|g\\left(r_{k}\\right)\\right|}{p_{k}} \\leq \\frac{M}{p_{k}} \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(\\alpha)=f\\left(\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} r_{k}\\right)=\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} f\\left(r_{k}\\right)=0\n\\]\n\nSo \\(\\alpha\\) is a root of \\(f\\) indeed.\nNow let \\(u_{k}, v_{k}\\) be relative prime integers for which \\(r_{k}=\\frac{u_{k}}{v_{k}}\\). Let \\(a\\) be the leading coefficient of \\(f\\), let \\(b=f(0)\\) and \\(c=g(0)\\) be the constant terms of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), respectively. The leading coefficient of the polynomial \\(p_{k} f+g\\) is \\(p_{k} a\\), its constant term is \\(p_{k} b+c\\). So \\(v_{k}\\) divides \\(p_{k} a\\) and \\(u_{k}\\) divides \\(p_{k} b+c\\). Let \\(p_{k} b+c=u_{k} e_{k}\\) (if \\(p_{k} b+c=u_{k}=0\\) then let \\(e_{k}=1\\) ).\n\nWe prove that \\(\\alpha\\) is rational by using the following fact. Let \\(\\left(p_{n}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(q_{n}\\right)\\) be sequences of integers such that the sequence \\(\\left(p_{n} / q_{n}\\right)\\) converges. If \\(\\left(p_{n}\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(q_{n}\\right)\\) is bounded then \\(\\lim \\left(p_{n} / q_{n}\\right)\\) is rational.\n\nCase 1: There is an infinite subsequence ( \\(k_{n}\\) ) of indices such that \\(v_{k_{n}}\\) divides \\(a\\). Then ( \\(v_{k_{n}}\\) ) is bounded, so \\(\\alpha=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(u_{k_{n}} / v_{k_{n}}\\right)\\) is rational.\n\nCase 2: There is an infinite subsequence \\(\\left(k_{n}\\right)\\) of indices such that \\(v_{k_{n}}\\) does not divide \\(a\\). For such indices we have \\(v_{k_{n}}=p_{k_{n}} d_{k_{n}}\\) where \\(d_{k_{n}}\\) is a divisor of \\(a\\). Then\n\n\\[\n\\alpha=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{u_{k_{n}}}{v_{k_{n}}}=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{p_{k_{n}} b+c}{p_{k_{n}} d_{k_{n}} e_{k_{n}}}=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{b}{d_{k_{n}} e_{k_{n}}}+\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{c}{p_{k_{n}} d_{k_{n}} e_{k_{n}}}=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{b}{d_{k_{n}} e_{k_{n}}}\n\\]\n\nBecause the numerator \\(b\\) in the last limit is bounded, \\(\\alpha\\) is rational."}

For instance, if we want to replace \\(m\\) by \\(m+1\\) then it is enough to define \\(P_{m+1, j}(x)=P_{m, j}(x)\\) and note that repeating elements of a set do not change its maximum nor its minimum. So one can assume that any two metapolynomials are defined with the same \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). We reserve letters \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) for polynomials, so every function called \\(P, P_{i, j}, Q, Q_{i, j}, \\ldots\\) is a polynomial function.\n\nWe start with a lemma that is useful to change expressions of the form min max \\(f_{i, j}\\) to ones of the form max min \\(g_{i, j}\\).\nLemma.

We can assume for all \\(i\\) that \\(a_{i, n}=\\max \\left\\{a_{i, 1}, \\ldots, a_{i, n}\\right\\}\\) and \\(a_{m, n}=\\min \\left\\{a_{1, n}, \\ldots, a_{m, n}\\right\\}\\). The left-hand side is \\(=a_{m, n}\\) and hence we need to prove the same for the right-hand side. If \\(\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \\ldots, j_{m}\\right)=(n, n, \\ldots, n)\\) then \\(\\min \\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\}=\\min \\left\\{a_{1, n}, \\ldots, a_{m, n}\\right\\}=a_{m, n}\\) which implies that the right-hand side is \\(\\geq a_{m, n}\\). It remains to prove the opposite inequality and this is equivalent to \\(\\min \\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\} \\leq a_{m, n}\\) for all possible \\(\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \\ldots, j_{m}\\right)\\). This is true because min \\(\\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\} \\leq a_{m, j_{m}} \\leq a_{m, n}\\).\n\nWe need to show that the family \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) of metapolynomials is closed under multiplication, but it turns out easier to prove more: that it is also closed under addition, maxima and minima.\n\nFirst we prove the assertions about the maxima and the minima. If \\(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\) are metapolynomials, assume them defined with the same \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). Then\n\n\\[\nf=\\max \\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right\\}=\\max \\left\\{\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{1}, \\ldots, \\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{r}\\right\\}=\\max _{s \\in[r], i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{s}\n\\]\n\nIt follows that \\(f=\\max \\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right\\}\\) is a metapolynomial. The same argument works for the minima, but first we have to replace min max by max min, and this is done via the lemma.\n\nAnother property we need is that if \\(f=\\max \\min P_{i, j}\\) is a metapolynomial then so is \\(-f\\). Indeed, \\(-f=\\min \\left(-\\min P_{i, j}\\right)=\\min \\max P_{i, j}\\).\n\nTo prove \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is closed under addition let \\(f=\\max \\min P_{i, j}\\) and \\(g=\\max \\min Q_{i, j}\\). Then\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(x)+g(x)=\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}(x)+\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} Q_{i, j}(x) \n=\\max _{i_{1}, i_{2} \\in[m]}\\left(\\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i_{1}, j}(x)+\\min _{j \\in[n]} Q_{i_{2}, j}(x)\\right)=\\max _{i_{1}, i_{2} \\in[m]} \\min _{j_{1}, j_{2} \\in[n]}\\left(P_{i_{1}, j_{1}}(x)+Q_{i_{2}, j_{2}}(x)\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nand hence \\(f(x)+g(x)\\) is a metapolynomial.\nWe proved that \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is closed under sums, maxima and minima, in particular any function that can be expressed by sums, max, min, polynomials or even metapolynomials is in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\).\n\nWe would like to proceed with multiplication along the same lines like with addition, but there is an essential difference. In general the product of the maxima of two sets is not equal\nto the maximum of the product of the sets. We need to deal with the fact that \\(a<b\\) and \\(c<d\\) do not imply \\(a c<b d\\). However this is true for \\(a, b, c, d \\geq 0\\).\n\nIn view of this we decompose each function \\(f(x)\\) into its positive part \\(f^{+}(x)=\\max \\{f(x), 0\\}\\) and its negative part \\(f^{-}(x)=\\max \\{0,-f(x)\\}\\). Note that \\(f=f^{+}-f^{-}\\)and \\(f^{+}, f^{-} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) if \\(f \\in \\mathcal{M}\\). The whole problem reduces to the claim that if \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are metapolynomials with \\(f, g \\geq 0\\) then \\(f g\\) it is also a metapolynomial.\n\nAssuming this claim, consider arbitrary \\(f, g \\in \\mathcal{M}\\). We have\n\n\\[\nf g=\\left(f^{+}-f^{-}\\right)\\left(g^{+}-g^{-}\\right)=f^{+} g^{+}-f^{+} g^{-}-f^{-} g^{+}+f^{-} g^{-}\n\\]\n\nand hence \\(f g \\in \\mathcal{M}\\). Indeed, \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is closed under addition, also \\(f^{+} g^{+}, f^{+} g^{-}, f^{-} g^{+}, f^{-} g^{-} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) because \\(f^{+}, f^{-}, g^{+}, g^{-} \\geq 0\\).\n\nIt remains to prove the claim. In this case \\(f, g \\geq 0\\), and one can try to repeat the argument for the sum. More precisely, let \\(f=\\max \\min P_{i j} \\geq 0\\) and \\(g=\\max \\min Q_{i j} \\geq 0\\). Then\n\n\\[\nf g=\\max \\min P_{i, j} \\cdot \\max \\min Q_{i, j}=\\max \\min P_{i, j}^{+} \\cdot \\max \\min Q_{i, j}^{+}=\\max \\min P_{i_{1}, j_{1}}^{+} \\cdot Q_{i_{2}, j_{2}}^{+}\n\\]\n\nHence it suffices to check that \\(P^{+} Q^{+} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) for any pair of polynomials \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). This reduces to the identity\n\n\\[\nu^{+} v^{+}=\\max \\left\\{0, \\min \\{u v, u, v\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, u^{2} v\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u, u^{2} v\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, v\\right\\}\\right\\},\n\\]\n\nwith \\(u\\) replaced by \\(P(x)\\) and \\(v\\) replaced by \\(Q(x)\\). The formula is proved by a case-by-case analysis. If \\(u \\leq 0\\) or \\(v \\leq 0\\) then both sides equal 0 . In case \\(u, v \\geq 0\\), the right-hand side is clearly \\(\\leq u v\\). To prove the opposite inequality we use that \\(u v\\) equals\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\min \\{u v, u, v\\} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq u, v \\leq 1 \n\\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, u^{2} v\\right\\} & \\text { if } 1 \\leq u, v \n\\min \\left\\{u v, u, u^{2} v\\right\\} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq v \\leq 1 \\leq u \n\\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, v\\right\\} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq u \\leq 1 \\leq v\n\n\\]\n\nComment. The case \\(k=1\\) is simpler and can be solved by proving that a function \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is a metapolynomial if and only if it is a piecewise polinomial (and continuos) function.\n\nIt is enough to prove that all such functions are metapolynomials, and this easily reduces to the following case. Given a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with \\(P(0)=0\\), the function \\(f\\) defined by \\(f(x)=P(x)\\) for \\(x \\geq 0\\) and 0 otherwise is a metapolynomial. For this last claim, it suffices to prove that \\(\\left(x^{+}\\right)^{n}\\) is a metapolynomial, and this follows from the formula \\(\\left(x^{+}\\right)^{n}=\\max \\left\\{0, \\min \\left\\{x^{n-1}, x^{n}\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{x^{n}, x^{n+1}\\right\\}\\right\\}\\)."}

If \\(s_{j}\\) decreases for some \\(j<i\\) then the new score sequence dominates the old one. Assume that \\(s_{j}\\) stays the same for all \\(j<i\\) and consider \\(s_{i}\\). Since \\(x>y\\) and \\(y \\leq a \\leq x\\), we see that \\(s_{i}\\) decreases by at least 1 . This concludes the proof.\n\nComment.

For \\(n=2012\\) this gives \\(N_{\\text {min }}=4022\\).\na) If \\(N=2 n-2\\) player \\(A\\) can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: \\(n-2\\) boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move \\(A\\) can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of \\(B\\) 's first move \\(M\\). She acts according as the following situation \\(S\\) occurs after \\(M\\) or not: The initial distribution contains a red box \\(R\\) with 2 white neighbors, and \\(R\\) receives no coins from them on move \\(M\\).\n\nSuppose that \\(S\\) does not occur. Exactly one of the coins \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) in a given red box \\(X\\) is involved in \\(M\\), say \\(c_{1}\\). If \\(M\\) passes \\(c_{1}\\) to the right neighbor of \\(X\\), let \\(A\\) pass \\(c_{2}\\) to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes \\(A\\) performs a legal move \\(M^{\\prime}\\). Thus \\(M\\) and \\(M^{\\prime}\\) combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after \\(M\\) and \\(M^{\\prime}\\) are complete each neighbor of a red box \\(X\\) contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in \\(X\\). So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after \\(M^{\\prime}\\). If initially there is a box \\(X\\) with 2 white neighbors ( \\(X\\) is red and unique) then \\(X\\) receives a coin from at least one of them on move \\(M\\) since \\(S\\) does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in \\(M^{\\prime}\\), so \\(X\\) is also non-empty after \\(M^{\\prime}\\). Furthermore each box \\(Y\\) has given away its initial content after \\(M\\) and \\(M^{\\prime}\\). A red neighbor of \\(Y\\) adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in \\(M^{\\prime}\\). Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after \\(M^{\\prime}\\). Because \\(N=2 n-2\\), such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let \\(S\\) occur after move \\(M\\). Then \\(A\\) leaves untouched the exceptional red box \\(R\\). With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\). Box \\(R\\) receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\). Like above \\(M\\) and \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\) combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from \\(R\\) to each of its neighbors. Every box except \\(R\\) has a red neighbor different from \\(R\\), hence all boxes are non-empty after \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\). Next, each box \\(Y\\) except \\(R\\) loses its initial content after \\(M\\) and \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\). A red neighbor of \\(Y\\) adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\). Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after \\(M^{\\prime \\prime}\\), and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer \\(A\\) can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so \\(N=2 n-2\\) enables her to succeed.\nb) For \\(N \\leq 2 n-3\\) player \\(B\\) can achieve an empty box after some move of \\(A\\). Let \\(\\alpha\\) be a set of \\(\\ell\\) consecutive boxes containing a total of \\(N(\\alpha)\\) coins. We call \\(\\alpha\\) an arc if \\(\\ell \\leq n-2\\) and \\(N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3\\). Note that \\(\\ell \\geq 2\\) by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of \\(\\alpha\\) are non-empty boxes then \\(N(\\alpha) \\geq 2\\), so that \\(N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3\\) implies \\(\\ell \\geq 3\\). Observe also that if an extreme \\(X\\) of \\(\\alpha\\) has more than 1 coin then ignoring \\(X\\) yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling \\(1,2, \\ldots, n\\) of the boxes, suppose that boxes \\(1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\) form an arc \\(\\alpha\\), with \\(\\ell \\leq n-2\\) and \\(N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3\\). Suppose also that all \\(n \\geq 7\\) boxes are non-empty. Then \\(B\\) can move so that an arc \\(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\) with \\(N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)\\) will appear after any response of \\(A\\).\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and \\(\\ell\\) by a previous remark. Let \\(B\\) pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box \\(n\\), and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves \\(N(\\alpha)-2\\) coins in the boxes of \\(\\alpha\\). In addition, due to \\(3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2\\), box \\(\\ell\\) has exactly 1 coin \\(c\\), the one received from box \\(\\ell-1\\).\n\nLet player \\(A\\) 's next move \\(M\\) pass \\(k \\leq 2\\) coins to boxes \\(1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\) from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and \\(\\ell\\) can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If \\(k<2\\) then after move \\(M\\) boxes \\(1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\) form an arc \\(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\) with \\(N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)\\). If \\(k=2\\) then \\(M\\) adds a coin to box \\(\\ell\\). Also \\(M\\) does not move coin \\(c\\) from \\(\\ell\\) because \\(c\\) is involved in the previous move of \\(B\\). In summary boxes \\(1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\) contain \\(N(\\alpha)\\) coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme \\(\\ell\\) of the arc. Ignore \\(\\ell\\) to obtain a shorter arc \\(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\) with \\(N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)\\).\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since \\(N \\leq 2 n-3\\), there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from \\(n \\geq 7\\) that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc \\(\\alpha\\). Hence \\(B\\) can make the move described above, which leads to an arc \\(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\) with \\(N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)\\) after \\(A\\) 's response. If all boxes in the new distribution are non-empty he can repeat the same, and so on. Because \\(N(\\alpha)\\) cannot decrease indefinitely, an empty box will occur after some move of \\(A\\)."}

This means we need a perfect matching between the \\(3 n^{2} \\mathrm{~A}\\)-squares and the \\(3 n^{2}\\) A-tokens such that the distance in each pair of the matching is at most \\(d+2\\).\n\nTo find the matching, we construct a bipartite graph. The A-squares will be the vertices in one class of the graph; the vertices in the other class will be the A-tokens.\n\nSplit the board into \\(3 \\times 1\\) horizontal triminos; then each trimino contains exactly one Asquare. Take a permutation \\(\\pi\\) of the tokens which moves A-tokens to B-tokens, B-tokens to C-tokens, and C-tokens to A-tokens, in each case to a distance at most \\(d\\). For each A-square \\(S\\), and for each A-token \\(T\\), connect \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) by an edge if \\(T, \\pi(T)\\) or \\(\\pi^{-1}(T)\\) is on the trimino containing \\(S\\). We allow multiple edges; it is even possible that the same square and the same token are connected with three edges. Obviously the lengths of the edges in the graph do not exceed \\(d+2\\). By length of an edge we mean the distance between the A-square and the A-token it connects.\n\nEach A-token \\(T\\) is connected with the three A-squares whose triminos contain \\(T, \\pi(T)\\) and \\(\\pi^{-1}(T)\\). Therefore in the graph all tokens are of degree 3 . We show that the same is true for the A-squares. Let \\(S\\) be an arbitrary A-square, and let \\(T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}\\) be the three tokens on the trimino containing \\(S\\). For \\(i=1,2,3\\), if \\(T_{i}\\) is an A-token, then \\(S\\) is connected with \\(T_{i}\\); if \\(T_{i}\\) is a B-token then \\(S\\) is connected with \\(\\pi^{-1}\\left(T_{i}\\right)\\); finally, if \\(T_{i}\\) is a C-token then \\(S\\) is connected with \\(\\pi\\left(T_{i}\\right)\\). Hence in the graph the A-squares also are of degree 3 .\n\nSince the A-squares are of degree 3 , from every set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of A-squares exactly \\(3|\\mathcal{S}|\\) edges start. These edges end in at least \\(|\\mathcal{S}|\\) tokens because the A-tokens also are of degree 3. Hence every set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of A-squares has at least \\(|\\mathcal{S}|\\) neighbors among the A-tokens.\n\nTherefore, by Hall's marriage theorem, the graph contains a perfect matching between the two vertex classes. So there is a perfect matching between the A-squares and A-tokens with edges no longer than \\(d+2\\). It follows that the tokens can be permuted as specified in the problem statement.\n\nComment 1. In the original problem proposal the board was infinite and there were only two colors. Having \\(n\\) colors for some positive integer \\(n\\) was an option; we chose \\(n=3\\). Moreover, we changed the board to a finite one to avoid dealing with infinite graphs (although Hall's theorem works in the infinite case as well).\n\nWith only two colors Hall's theorem is not needed. In this case we split the board into \\(2 \\times 1\\) dominos, and in the resulting graph all vertices are of degree 2 . The graph consists of disjoint cycles with even length and infinite paths, so the existence of the matching is trivial.\n\nHaving more than three colors would make the problem statement more complicated, because we need a matching between every two color classes of tokens. However, this would not mean a significant increase in difficulty.\n\nComment 2. According to Wikipedia, the color asparagus (hexadecimal code \\#87A96B) is a tone of green that is named after the vegetable. Crayola created this color in 1993 as one of the 16 to be named in the Name The Color Contest. Byzantium (\\#702963) is a dark tone of purple. Its first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1926. Citrine (\\#E4D00A) is variously described as yellow, greenish-yellow, brownish-yellow or orange. The first known use of citrine as a color name in English was in the 14th century."}

We keep the same convention for the sequel.\n\nWe prove that the lines \\(A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}, C C^{\\prime}\\) intersect at one point by Ceva's theorem. To avoid distracting remarks we interpret everything projectively, i. e. whenever two lines are parallel they meet at a point on the line at infinity.\n\nLet \\(U, V, W\\) be the intersections of \\(A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}, C C^{\\prime}\\) with \\(B C, C A, A B\\) respectively. The idea is that although it is difficult to calculate the ratio \\(\\frac{B U}{C U}\\), it is easier to deal with the cross-ratio \\(\\frac{B U}{C U} / \\frac{B X}{C X}\\) because we can send it to the line \\(\\ell\\). With this in mind we apply Menelaus' theorem to the triangle \\(A B C\\) and obtain \\(\\frac{B X}{C X} \\cdot \\frac{C Y}{A Y} \\cdot \\frac{A Z}{B Z}=1\\). Hence Ceva's ratio can be expressed as\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B U}{C U} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W}=\\frac{B U}{C U} / \\frac{B X}{C X} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} / \\frac{C Y}{A Y} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W} / \\frac{A Z}{B Z}\n\\]\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2025_05_30_6fdca1c2bf1a061018cfg-39}\n\n\nProject the line \\(B C\\) to \\(\\ell\\) from \\(A\\). The cross-ratio between \\(B C\\) and \\(U X\\) equals the cross-ratio between \\(Z Y\\) and \\(X^{\\prime} X\\). Repeating the same argument with the lines \\(C A\\) and \\(A B\\) gives\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B U}{C U} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W}=\\frac{Z X^{\\prime}}{Y X^{\\prime}} / \\frac{Z X}{Y X} \\cdot \\frac{X Y^{\\prime}}{Z Y^{\\prime}} / \\frac{X Y}{Z Y} \\cdot \\frac{Y Z^{\\prime}}{X Z^{\\prime}} / \\frac{Y Z}{X Z}\n\\]\n\nand hence\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B U}{C U} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W}=(-1) \\cdot \\frac{Z X^{\\prime}}{Y X^{\\prime}} \\cdot \\frac{X Y^{\\prime}}{Z Y^{\\prime}} \\cdot \\frac{Y Z^{\\prime}}{X Z^{\\prime}} .\n\\]\n\nThe equations (1) reduce the problem to a straightforward computation on the line \\(\\ell\\). For instance, the transformation \\(t \\mapsto-k^{2} / t\\) preserves cross-ratio and interchanges the points \\(X, Y, Z\\) with the points \\(X^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}, Z^{\\prime}\\). Then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B U}{C U} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W}=(-1) \\cdot \\frac{Z X^{\\prime}}{Y X^{\\prime}} / \\frac{Z Z^{\\prime}}{Y Z^{\\prime}} \\cdot \\frac{X Y^{\\prime}}{Z Y^{\\prime}} / \\frac{X Z^{\\prime}}{Z Z^{\\prime}}=-1 .\n\\]\n\nWe proved that Ceva's ratio equals -1 , so \\(A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}, C C^{\\prime}\\) intersect at one point \\(Q\\).\nComment 1. There is a nice projective argument to prove that \\(A X^{\\prime}, B Y^{\\prime}, C Z^{\\prime}\\) intersect at one point. Suppose that \\(\\ell\\) and \\(\\omega\\) intersect at a pair of complex conjugate points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\). Consider a projective transformation that takes \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) to \\([i ; 1,0]\\) and \\([-i, 1,0]\\). Then \\(\\ell\\) is the line at infinity, and \\(\\omega\\) is a conic through the special points \\([i ; 1,0]\\) and \\([-i, 1,0]\\), hence it is a circle. So one can assume that \\(A X, B Y, C Z\\) are parallel to \\(B C, C A, A B\\). The involution on \\(\\ell\\) taking \\(X, Y, Z\\) to \\(X^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}, Z^{\\prime}\\) and leaving \\(D, E\\) fixed is the involution changing each direction to its perpendicular one. Hence \\(A X, B Y, C Z\\) are also perpendicular to \\(A X^{\\prime}, B Y^{\\prime}, C Z^{\\prime}\\).\n\nIt follows from the above that \\(A X^{\\prime}, B Y^{\\prime}, C Z^{\\prime}\\) intersect at the orthocenter of triangle \\(A B C\\).\nComment 2. The restriction that the line \\(\\ell\\) does not intersect the circumcricle \\(\\omega\\) is unnecessary. The proof above works in general. In case \\(\\ell\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) at \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) point \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(D E\\), and some equations can be interpreted differently. For instance\n\n\\[\nX^{\\prime} P \\cdot X^{\\prime} X=X^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} \\cdot X^{\\prime} A=X^{\\prime} D \\cdot X^{\\prime} E,\n\\]\n\nand hence the pairs \\(X^{\\prime} X\\) and \\(D E\\) are harmonic conjugates. This means that \\(X^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}, Z^{\\prime}\\) are the harmonic conjugates of \\(X, Y, Z\\) with respect to the segment \\(D E\\).\n\nSolution 2. First we prove that there is an inversion in space that takes \\(\\ell\\) and \\(\\omega\\) to parallel circles on a sphere. Let \\(Q R\\) be the diameter of \\(\\omega\\) whose extension beyond \\(Q\\) passes through \\(P\\). Let \\(\\Pi\\) be the plane carrying our objects. In space, choose a point \\(O\\) such that the line \\(Q O\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\Pi\\) and \\(\\angle P O R=90^{\\circ}\\), and apply an inversion with pole \\(O\\) (the radius of the inversion does not matter). For any object \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) denote by \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) the image of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) under this inversion.\n\nThe inversion takes the plane \\(\\Pi\\) to a sphere \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\). The lines in \\(\\Pi\\) are taken to circles through \\(O\\), and the circles in \\(\\Pi\\) also are taken to circles on \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_6fdca1c2bf1a061018cfg-40}\n\nSince the line \\(\\ell\\) and the circle \\(\\omega\\) are perpendicular to the plane \\(O P Q\\), the circles \\(\\ell^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\omega^{\\prime}\\) also are perpendicular to this plane. Hence, the planes of the circles \\(\\ell^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\omega^{\\prime}\\) are parallel.\n\nNow consider the circles \\(A^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}\\). We want to prove that either they have a common point (on \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\) ), different from \\(P^{\\prime}\\), or they are tangent to each other.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_6fdca1c2bf1a061018cfg-40(1)}\n\nThe point \\(X^{\\prime}\\) is the second intersection of the circles \\(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} O\\) and \\(\\ell^{\\prime}\\), other than \\(O\\). Hence, the lines \\(O X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) are coplanar. Moreover, they lie in the parallel planes of \\(\\ell^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\omega^{\\prime}\\). Therefore, \\(O X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) are parallel. Analogously, \\(O Y^{\\prime}\\) and \\(O Z^{\\prime}\\) are parallel to \\(A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) and \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}\\).\n\nLet \\(A_{1}\\) be the second intersection of the circles \\(A^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\omega^{\\prime}\\), other than \\(A^{\\prime}\\). The segments \\(A^{\\prime} A_{1}\\) and \\(P^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}\\) are coplanar, and therefore parallel. Now we know that \\(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) and \\(A^{\\prime} A_{1}\\) are parallel to \\(O X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(X^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}\\) respectively, but these two segments are perpendicular because \\(O P^{\\prime}\\) is a diameter in \\(\\ell^{\\prime}\\). We found that \\(A^{\\prime} A_{1}\\) and \\(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) are perpendicular, hence \\(A^{\\prime} A_{1}\\) is the altitude in the triangle \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\), starting from \\(A\\).\n\nAnalogously, let \\(B_{1}\\) and \\(C_{1}\\) be the second intersections of \\(\\omega^{\\prime}\\) with the circles \\(B^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\), other than \\(B^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C^{\\prime}\\) respectively. Then \\(B^{\\prime} B_{1}\\) and \\(C^{\\prime} C_{1}\\) are the other two altitudes in the triangle \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\).\n\nLet \\(H\\) be the orthocenter of the triangle \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\). Let \\(W\\) be the second intersection of the line \\(P^{\\prime} H\\) with the sphere \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\), other than \\(P^{\\prime}\\). The point \\(W\\) lies on the sphere \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\), in the plane of the circle \\(A^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}\\), so \\(W\\) lies on the circle \\(A^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}\\). Similarly, \\(W\\) lies on the circles \\(B^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}\\) as well; indeed \\(W\\) is the second common point of the three circles.\n\nIf the line \\(P^{\\prime} H\\) is tangent to the sphere then \\(W\\) coincides with \\(P^{\\prime}\\), and \\(P^{\\prime} H\\) is the common tangent of the three circles."}

In particular, if a root of unity \\(\\xi\\) is a root of \\(f(x)\\) then \\(1=\\xi^{d}\\) is a root too (for some positive integer \\(d\\) ). In the original problem \\(f(x)\\) has nonnegative coefficients. Then either \\(f(x)\\) is the zero polynomial or \\(f(1)>0\\) and \\(\\xi=0\\) is the only possible root.

If 0 or 1 are roots of \\(g(x)\\) then either \\(\\xi=0\\) or \\(\\xi=1\\) (because \\(g(x)\\) is irreducible) and we are done. So assume that \\(g(0), g(1) \\neq 0\\).

On the other hand, for large enough \\(k\\), the maximal power of 2 dividing \\(g\\left(2^{k}\\right)\\) and \\(g(0) \\neq 0\\) is the same. From the above, for \\(k\\) divisible by \\(\\varphi\\left(p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}+1} \\cdots p_{n}^{\\alpha_{n}+1}\\right)\\) and large enough, we obtain that \\(g\\left(2^{k}\\right)\\) divides \\(g(0) \\cdot g(1)\\).

So we have \\(k \\leq 1+5(p-1)=5 p-4\\).\n\n\nThe values \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) must satisfy \\(a^{2} \\equiv c^{2}\\), so \\(a \\equiv \\pm c\\), and there are exactly \\(2 p-1\\) such pairs \\((a, c)\\).\n2. Now suppose \\(b^{5} \\not \\equiv d^{5}\\). In this case \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) must be distinct. By \\((a-c)(a+c)=d^{5}-b^{5}\\), the value of \\(a-c\\) uniquely determines \\(a+c\\) and thus \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) as well. Hence, there are \\(p-1\\) suitable pairs \\((a, c)\\).\n\nThus, for each of the \\(k\\) pairs ( \\(b, d\\) ) with \\(b^{5} \\equiv d^{5}\\) there are \\(2 p-1\\) pairs ( \\(a, c\\) ), and for each of the other \\(p^{2}-k\\) pairs ( \\(b, d\\) ) there are \\(p-1\\) pairs ( \\(a, c\\) ). Hence,\n\n\\[\nN=k(2 p-1)+\\left(p^{2}-k\\right)(p-1)=p^{2}(p-1)+k p \\leq p^{2}(p-1)+(5 p-4) p=p\\left(p^{2}+4 p-4\\right)\n\\]\n\nTo prove the statement of the problem, suppose that \\(S_{r}=\\emptyset\\) for some \\(r \\in \\mathcal{P}\\); obviously \\(r \\not \\equiv 0\\). Let \\(T=\\left\\{x^{10}: x \\in \\mathcal{P} \\backslash\\{0\\}\\right\\}\\) be the set of nonzero 10th powers modulo \\(p\\). Since each residue class is the 10 th power of at most 10 elements in \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), we have \\(|T| \\geq \\frac{p-1}{10} \\geq 4\\) by \\(p>100\\).\n\nFor every \\(t \\in T\\), we have \\(S_{t r}=\\emptyset\\). Indeed, if \\((x, y) \\in S_{t r}\\) and \\(t \\equiv z^{10}\\) then\n\n\\[\n\\left(z^{-5} x\\right)^{2}+\\left(z^{-2} y\\right)^{5} \\equiv t^{-1}\\left(x^{2}+y^{5}\\right) \\equiv r\n\\]\n\nso \\(\\left(z^{-5} x, z^{-2} y\\right) \\in S_{r}\\). So, there are at least \\(\\frac{p-1}{10} \\geq 4\\) empty sets among \\(S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{p-1}\\), and there are at most \\(p-4\\) nonzero values among \\(s_{0}, s_{2}, \\ldots, s_{p-1}\\). Then by the AM-QM inequality we obtain\n\n\\[\nN=\\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{P} \\backslash r T} s_{r}^{2} \\geq \\frac{1}{p-4}\\left(\\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{P} \\backslash r T} s_{r}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{|\\mathcal{P} \\times \\mathcal{P}|^{2}}{p-4}=\\frac{p^{4}}{p-4}>p\\left(p^{2}+4 p-4\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhich is impossible by the lemma.\n\nSolution 2. If \\(5 \\nmid p-1\\), then all modulo \\(p\\) residue classes are complete fifth powers and the statement is trivial. So assume that \\(p=10 k+1\\) where \\(k \\geq 10\\). Let \\(g\\) be a primitive root modulo \\(p\\).\n\nWe will use the following facts:\n(F1) If some residue class \\(x\\) is not quadratic then \\(x^{(p-1) / 2} \\equiv-1(\\bmod p)\\).\n(F2) For every integer \\(d\\), as a simple corollary of the summation formula for geometric progressions,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1} g^{5 d i} \\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 k & \\text { if } 2 k \\mid d \n0 & \\text { if } 2 k \\not k d\n \\quad(\\bmod p)\\right.\n\\]\n\nSuppose that, contrary to the statement, some modulo \\(p\\) residue class \\(r\\) cannot be expressed as \\(a^{2}+b^{5}\\). Of course \\(r \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)\\). By (F1) we have \\(\\left(r-b^{5}\\right)^{(p-1) / 2}=\\left(r-b^{5}\\right)^{5 k} \\equiv-1(\\bmod p)\\) for all residue classes \\(b\\).\n\nFor \\(t=1,2 \\ldots, k-1\\) consider the sums\n\n\\[\nS(t)=\\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1}\\left(r-g^{5 i}\\right)^{5 k} g^{5 t i}\n\\]\n\nBy the indirect assumption and (F2),\n\n\\[\nS(t)=\\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1}\\left(r-\\left(g^{i}\\right)^{5}\\right)^{5 k} g^{5 t i} \\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1}(-1) g^{5 t i} \\equiv-\\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1} g^{5 t i} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod p)\n\\]\n\nbecause \\(2 k\\) cannot divide \\(t\\).\nOn the other hand, by the binomial theorem,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(t) & =\\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{5 k}\\binom{5 k}{j} r^{5 k-j}\\left(-g^{5 i}\\right)^{j}\\right) g^{5 t i}=\\sum_{j=0}^{5 k}(-1)^{j}\\binom{5 k}{j} r^{5 k-j}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{2 k-1} g^{5(j+t) i}\\right) \\equiv \n& \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^{5 k}(-1)^{j}\\binom{5 k}{j} r^{5 k-j}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 k & \\text { if } 2 k \\mid j+t \n0 & \\text { if } 2 k \\not 2 \\nmid j+t\n \\quad(\\bmod p) .\\right.\n\n\\]\n\nSince \\(1 \\leq j+t<6 k\\), the number \\(2 k\\) divides \\(j+t\\) only for \\(j=2 k-t\\) and \\(j=4 k-t\\). Hence,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n0 \\equiv S(t) \\equiv(-1)^{t}\\left(\\binom{5 k}{2 k-t} r^{3 k+t}+\\binom{5 k}{4 k-t} r^{k+t}\\right) \\cdot 2 k \\quad(\\bmod p) \n\\binom{5 k}{2 k-t} r^{2 k}+\\binom{5 k}{4 k-t} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod p)\n\n\\]\n\nTaking this for \\(t=1,2\\) and eliminating \\(r\\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & \\equiv\\binom{5 k}{2 k-2}\\left(\\binom{5 k}{2 k-1} r^{2 k}+\\binom{5 k}{4 k-1}\\right)-\\binom{5 k}{2 k-1}\\left(\\binom{5 k}{2 k-2} r^{2 k}+\\binom{5 k}{4 k-2}\\right) \n& =\\binom{5 k}{2 k-2}\\binom{5 k}{4 k-1}-\\binom{5 k}{2 k-1}\\binom{5 k}{4 k-2} \n& =\\frac{(5 k)!^{2}}{(2 k-1)!(3 k+2)!(4 k-1)!(k+2)!}((2 k-1)(k+2)-(3 k+2)(4 k-1)) \n& =\\frac{-(5 k)!^{2} \\cdot 2 k(5 k+1)}{(2 k-1)!(3 k+2)!(4 k-1)!(k+2)!}(\\bmod p) .\n\n\\]\n\nBut in the last expression none of the numbers is divisible by \\(p=10 k+1\\), a contradiction.\n\nComment 1. The argument in the second solution is valid whenever \\(k \\geq 3\\), that is for all primes \\(p=10 k+1\\) except \\(p=11\\). This is an exceptional case when the statement is not true; \\(r=7\\) cannot be expressed as desired.\n\nComment 2. The statement is true in a more general setting: for every positive integer \\(n\\), for all sufficiently large \\(p\\), each residue class modulo \\(p\\) can be expressed as \\(a^{2}+b^{n}\\). Choosing \\(t=3\\) would allow using the Cauchy-Davenport theorem (together with some analysis on the case of equality).\n\nIn the literature more general results are known. For instance, the statement easily follows from the Hasse-Weil bound."}

What is the minimum number of guesses (in terms of \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) ) needed to guarantee the correct answer?\n\nAnswer. The minimum number of guesses is 2 if \\(n=2 k\\) and 1 if \\(n \\neq 2 k\\).", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2016, "solution": "Let \\(X\\) be the binary string chosen by the leader and let \\(X^{\\prime}\\) be the binary string of length \\(n\\) every digit of which is different from that of \\(X\\). The strings written by the deputy leader are the same as those in the case when the leader's string is \\(X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(k\\) is changed to \\(n-k\\). In view of this, we may assume \\(k \\geqslant \\frac{n}{2}\\). Also, for the particular case \\(k=\\frac{n}{2}\\), this argument shows that the strings \\(X\\) and \\(X^{\\prime}\\) cannot be distinguished, and hence in that case the contestant has to guess at least twice.\n\nIt remains to show that the number of guesses claimed suffices. Consider any string \\(Y\\) which differs from \\(X\\) in \\(m\\) digits where \\(0<m<2 k\\). Without loss of generality, assume the first \\(m\\) digits of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are distinct. Let \\(Z\\) be the binary string obtained from \\(X\\) by changing its first \\(k\\) digits. Then \\(Z\\) is written by the deputy leader. Note that \\(Z\\) differs from \\(Y\\) by \\(|m-k|\\) digits where \\(|m-k|<k\\) since \\(0<m<2 k\\). From this observation, the contestant must know that \\(Y\\) is not the desired string.\n\nAs we have assumed \\(k \\geqslant \\frac{n}{2}\\), when \\(n<2 k\\), every string \\(Y \\neq X\\) differs from \\(X\\) in fewer than \\(2 k\\) digits. When \\(n=2 k\\), every string except \\(X\\) and \\(X^{\\prime}\\) differs from \\(X\\) in fewer than \\(2 k\\) digits. Hence, the answer is as claimed.\n\nSolution 2. Firstly, assume \\(n \\neq 2 k\\). Without loss of generality suppose the first digit of the leader's string is 1 . Then among the \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) strings written by the deputy leader, \\(\\binom{n-1}{k}\\) will begin with 1 and \\(\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\) will begin with 0 . Since \\(n \\neq 2 k\\), we have \\(k+(k-1) \\neq n-1\\) and so \\(\\binom{n-1}{k} \\neq\\binom{ n-1}{k-1}\\). Thus, by counting the number of strings written by the deputy leader that start with 0 and 1 , the contestant can tell the first digit of the leader's string. The same can be done on the other digits, so 1 guess suffices when \\(n \\neq 2 k\\).\n\nSecondly, for the case \\(n=2\\) and \\(k=1\\), the answer is clearly 2 . For the remaining cases where \\(n=2 k>2\\), the deputy leader would write down the same strings if the leader's string \\(X\\) is replaced by \\(X^{\\prime}\\) obtained by changing each digit of \\(X\\). This shows at least 2 guesses are needed. We shall show that 2 guesses suffice in this case. Suppose the first two digits of the leader's string are the same. Then among the strings written by the deputy leader, the prefices 01 and 10 will occur \\(\\binom{2 k-2}{k-1}\\) times each, while the prefices 00 and 11 will occur \\(\\binom{2 k-2}{k}\\) times each. The two numbers are interchanged if the first two digits of the leader's string are different. Since \\(\\binom{2 k-2}{k-1} \\neq\\binom{ 2 k-2}{k}\\), the contestant can tell whether the first two digits of the leader's string are the same or not. He can work out the relation of the first digit and the\nother digits in the same way and reduce the leader's string to only 2 possibilities. The proof is complete."}

No other diagonal in \\(S\\) can start from either endpoint of that diagonal, since otherwise it has to meet another longer diagonal in \\(S\\). The same holds true for the other direction.

Suppose we have two sets \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) which form a network where \\(3 \\leqslant|\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}|<n\\). This relation no longer holds only when a ferry route between islands \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\) is closed. In that case, we define \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}=\\{A, B\\}\\), and \\(\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}=(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B})-\\{A, B\\}\\). Note that \\(\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\) is nonempty. Consider any island \\(C \\in \\mathcal{A}-\\{A\\}\\). From the relation of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), we know that \\(C\\) is connected to \\(B\\). If \\(C\\) was not connected to \\(A\\) before the route between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) closes, then there will be a route added between \\(C\\) and \\(A\\) afterwards. Hence, \\(C\\) must now be connected to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The same holds true for any island in \\(\\mathcal{B}-\\{B\\}\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\) form a network, and \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime} \\cup \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\). Hence these islands can always be partitioned into sets \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) which form a network.\n\nAs \\(|\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}|<n\\), there are some islands which are not included in \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\). From the condition, after some years there must be a ferry route between an island \\(A\\) in \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\) and an island \\(D\\) outside \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\) which closes. Without loss of generality assume \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). Then each island in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) must then be connected to \\(D\\), no matter it was or not before. Hence, we can put \\(D\\) in set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) so that the new sets \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) still form a network and the size of \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\) is increased by 1 . The same process can be done to increase the size of \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}\\). Eventually, all islands are included in this way so we may now assume \\(|\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}|=n\\).\n\nSuppose a ferry route between \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\) is closed after some years. We put \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in set \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}\\) and all remaining islands in set \\(\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\) form a network. This relation no longer holds only when a route between \\(A\\), without loss of generality, and \\(C \\in \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\) is closed. Since this must eventually occur, at that time island \\(B\\) will be connected to all other islands and the result follows."}

Let \\(d\\) be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of \\(P\\). Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in \\(d\\) are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell \\(c\\) lying on the diagonal \\(d\\). Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to \\(d\\). Thus they connect \\(c\\) to different cells. This shows \\(c\\) belongs to a cycle \\(C(c)\\) of length at least 4 .

As \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(C F, M\\) lies on the circumcircle of triangle \\(D A B\\) and it is the centre of the circle passing through \\(D, F, B, C\\). By symmetry, \\(D E F M\\) is a rhombus.

The proof is thus complete.\n  \\item Method 2. Here, we finish the proof without using the Butterfly Theorem. As \\(D T T_{1} D_{1}\\) is an isosceles trapezoid, we have\n\n\n\\[\n\\measuredangle Y T D=\\measuredangle Y T T_{1}+\\measuredangle T_{1} T D=\\measuredangle Y A T_{1}+\\measuredangle A D_{1} D=\\measuredangle Y M D\n\\]\n\nso that \\(D, T, Y, M\\) are concyclic. As \\(X, M, T_{1}\\) are collinear, we have\n\n\\[\n\\measuredangle A Y D=\\measuredangle M T D=\\measuredangle D_{1} T_{1} M=\\measuredangle A T_{1} X=\\measuredangle A Y X .\n\\]\n\nThis shows \\(X, D, Y\\) are collinear."}

From this, it follows that \\(n\\) is divisible by 3 .\n\nIf the sequence contains two consecutive positive numbers \\(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\\), then \\(a_{i+2}=a_{i} a_{i+1}+1>1\\), so the next value is positive as well; by induction, all numbers are positive and greater than 1.

Hence, the positive and negative numbers follow each other in such a way that each positive term is followed by one or two negative values and then comes the next positive term.\n\nConsider the case when the positive and negative values alternate. So, if \\(a_{i}\\) is a negative value then \\(a_{i+1}\\) is positive, \\(a_{i+2}\\) is negative and \\(a_{i+3}\\) is positive again.\n\nNotice that \\(a_{i} a_{i+1}+1=a_{i+2}<0<a_{i+3}=a_{i+1} a_{i+2}+1\\); by \\(a_{i+1}>0\\) we conclude \\(a_{i}<a_{i+2}\\). Hence, the negative values form an infinite increasing subsequence, \\(a_{i}<a_{i+2}<a_{i+4}<\\ldots\\), which is not possible, because the sequence is periodic.\n\nThe only case left is when there are consecutive negative numbers in the sequence.

That completes the solution.\n\nSolution 2. We prove that the shortest period of the sequence must be 3. Then it follows that \\(n\\) must be divisible by 3 .\n\nNotice that the equation \\(x^{2}+1=x\\) has no real root, so the numbers \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\) cannot be all equal, hence the shortest period of the sequence cannot be 1 .\n\nBy applying the recurrence relation for \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left(a_{i+2}-1\\right) a_{i+2}=a_{i} a_{i+1} a_{i+2}=a_{i}\\left(a_{i+3}-1\\right), \\quad \\text { so } \na_{i+2}^{2}-a_{i} a_{i+3}=a_{i+2}-a_{i}\n\n\\]\n\nBy summing over \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(a_{i}-a_{i+3}\\right)^{2}=0\n\\]\n\nThat proves that \\(a_{i}=a_{i+3}\\) for every index \\(i\\), so the sequence \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots\\) is indeed periodic with period 3.

We use induction on \\(n\\). The base case \\(n=2\\) is routine. To perform the induction step, we need to prove the inequalities\n\n\\[\n\\frac{S(n, n)}{n} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n-1}\n\\]\n\nfor every positive integer \\(k \\leqslant n\\). Clearly, these inequalities hold for \\(k=n\\) and \\(k=n-1\\), as \\(S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)>0\\). In the sequel, we assume that \\(k<n-1\\).\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as \\(n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))\\), or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n\\[\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n\\]\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have \\(S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}\\). By Claim 3, we get \\(a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}\\) for all \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, k\\). Summing these \\(k\\) inequalities we obtain\n\n\\[\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n\\]\n\nas required.\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k}\n\n\\]\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in \\(S(n, k)\\) is at most \\(M_{n-k}\\).\nNow we can prove the required estimate for \\(a_{2018}-a_{2017}\\). Set \\(N=2017\\). By Claim 4,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant M_{N+1}-a_{N}=\\frac{S(N+1, N)}{N}-a_{N} & =\\frac{a_{N}+S(N, N-1)}{N}-a_{N} \n& =\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot a_{N}\n\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, the same Claim yields\n\n\\[\na_{N} \\geqslant m_{N}=\\frac{S(N, N)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}\n\\]\n\nNoticing that each term in \\(S(N, N-1)\\) is at most 1 , so \\(S(N, N-1) \\leqslant N-1\\), we finally obtain\n\n\\[\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N^{2}} \\leqslant \\frac{N-1}{N^{2}} .\n\\]\n\nComment 1. Claim 1 in Solution 1 can be deduced from Claims 2 and 4 in Solution 2.\nBy Claim 4 we have \\(M_{n}=\\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n-1}\\) and \\(m_{n}=\\frac{S(n, n)}{n}=\\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n}\\). It follows that \\(\\Delta_{n}=M_{n}-m_{n}=\\) \\(\\frac{S(n, n-1)}{(n-1) n}\\) and so \\(M_{n}=n \\Delta_{n}\\) and \\(m_{n}=(n-1) \\Delta_{n}\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(M_{n-1}=(n-1) \\Delta_{n-1}\\) and \\(m_{n-1}=(n-2) \\Delta_{n-1}\\). Then the inequalities \\(m_{n-1} \\leqslant m_{n}\\) and \\(M_{n} \\leqslant M_{n-1}\\) from Claim 2 write as \\((n-2) \\Delta_{n-1} \\leqslant(n-1) \\Delta_{n}\\) and \\(n \\Delta_{n} \\leqslant(n-1) \\Delta_{n-1}\\). Hence we have the double inequality\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n-2}{n-1} \\Delta_{n-1} \\leqslant \\Delta_{n} \\leqslant \\frac{n-1}{n} \\Delta_{n-1}\n\\]\n\nComment 2. Both solutions above discuss the properties of an arbitrary sequence satisfying the problem conditions. Instead, one may investigate only an optimal sequence which maximises the value of \\(a_{2018}-a_{2017}\\). Here we present an observation which allows to simplify such investigation - for instance, the proofs of Claim 1 in Solution 1 and Claim 4 in Solution 2.\n\nThe sequence \\(\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\) is uniquely determined by choosing, for every \\(n \\geqslant 2\\), a positive integer \\(k(n) \\leqslant n\\) such that \\(a_{n}=S(n, k(n)) / k(n)\\). Take an arbitrary \\(2 \\leqslant n_{0} \\leqslant 2018\\), and assume that all such integers \\(k(n)\\), for \\(n \\neq n_{0}\\), are fixed. Then, for every \\(n\\), the value of \\(a_{n}\\) is a linear function in \\(a_{n_{0}}\\) (whose possible values constitute some discrete subset of \\(\\left[m_{n_{0}}, M_{n_{0}}\\right]\\) containing both endpoints). Hence, \\(a_{2018}-a_{2017}\\) is also a linear function in \\(a_{n_{0}}\\), so it attains its maximal value at one of the endpoints of the segment \\(\\left[m_{n_{0}}, M_{n_{0}}\\right]\\).\n\nThis shows that, while dealing with an optimal sequence, we may assume \\(a_{n} \\in\\left\\{m_{n}, M_{n}\\right\\}\\) for all \\(2 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 2018\\). Now one can easily see that, if \\(a_{n}=m_{n}\\), then \\(m_{n+1}=m_{n}\\) and \\(M_{n+1} \\leqslant \\frac{m_{n}+n M_{n}}{n+1}\\); similar estimates hold in the case \\(a_{n}=M_{n}\\). This already establishes Claim 1, and simplifies the inductive proof of Claim 4, both applied to an optimal sequence."}

Therefore we can apply the induction hypothesis to \\(F_{1}\\) and \\(G_{1}\\) and conclude that \\(F_{1}\\) is not the zero polynomial and \\(\\operatorname{deg} F_{1} \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} G_{1}\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} F_{1}+1 \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} G_{1}+1=\\operatorname{deg} G\\).

Notice further that the constraints \\(g(0)=g(1)=0\\) and \\(g(m)=1\\) together enforce \\(\\operatorname{deg} g \\geqslant 2\\).\n\nBy applying the lemma to \\(a_{1}=\\ldots=a_{n}=m-1\\) and the polynomials \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), we achieve \\(\\operatorname{deg} f \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} g\\). Hence we just need a suitable lower bound on \\(\\operatorname{deg} g\\).\n\nConsider the polynomial \\(h(x)=g(x+m)-g(x)-1\\).

Then \\(\\operatorname{deg} P \\geqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-1\\right)\\).\n(A well-known application of the Alon-Füredi bound was the former IMO problem 2007/6. Since then, this result became popular among the students and is part of the IMO training for many IMO teams.)\n\nThe proof of the lemma can be replaced by an application of the Alon-Füredi bound as follows. Let \\(d=\\operatorname{deg} G\\), and let \\(G_{0}\\) be the unique polynomial such that \\(G_{0}(x)=G(x)\\) for \\(x \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\}\\) but \\(\\operatorname{deg} G_{0}<d\\). The polynomials \\(G_{0}\\) and \\(G\\) are different because they have different degrees, and they attain the same values at \\(0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\); that enforces \\(G_{0}(d) \\neq G(d)\\).\n\nChoose some nonnegative integers \\(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\) so that \\(b_{1} \\leqslant a_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n} \\leqslant a_{n}\\), and \\(b_{1}+\\ldots+b_{n}=d\\), and consider the polynomial\n\n\\[\nH\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=F\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)-G_{0}\\left(x_{1}+\\ldots+x_{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\non the grid \\(\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, b_{1}\\right\\} \\times \\ldots \\times\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}\\).\nAt the point \\(\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)\\) we have \\(H\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)=G(d)-G_{0}(d) \\neq 0\\). At all other points of the grid we have \\(F=G\\) and therefore \\(H=G-G_{0}=0\\). So, by the Alon-Füredi bound, \\(\\operatorname{deg} H \\geqslant b_{1}+\\ldots+b_{n}=d\\).

So, the best time to schedule the match between \\(P_{i}\\) and \\(P_{j}\\) is either when \\(P_{\\max (i, j)}\\) arrives, or when \\(Q_{\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)}\\) departs, in which case the cost is \\(\\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)\\).\n\nConversely, assuming that \\(i>j\\), if this match is scheduled between the arrivals of \\(P_{i}\\) and \\(P_{i+1}\\), then its cost will be exactly \\(i=\\max (i, j)\\). Similarly, one can make it cost \\(\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\). Obviously, these conditions can all be simultaneously satisfied, so the minimal cost for a fixed sequence \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}\\right)=\\sum_{1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant 2 k} \\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\nOptimising the sequence ( \\(a_{i}\\) ). Optimisation hinges on the lemma below.\nLemma. If \\(a \\leqslant b\\) and \\(c \\leqslant d\\), then\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min (\\max (a, x), \\max (c, y))+\\min & (\\max (b, x), \\max (d, y)) \n\\geqslant & \\min (\\max (a, x), \\max (d, y))+\\min (\\max (b, x), \\max (c, y))\n\n\\]\n\nProof. Write \\(a^{\\prime}=\\max (a, x) \\leqslant \\max (b, x)=b^{\\prime}\\) and \\(c^{\\prime}=\\max (c, y) \\leqslant \\max (d, y)=d^{\\prime}\\) and check that \\(\\min \\left(a^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right)+\\min \\left(b^{\\prime}, d^{\\prime}\\right) \\geqslant \\min \\left(a^{\\prime}, d^{\\prime}\\right)+\\min \\left(b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right)\\).\n\nConsider a permutation \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}\\) such that \\(a_{i}<a_{j}\\) for some \\(i<j\\). Swapping \\(a_{i}\\) and \\(a_{j}\\) does not change the ( \\(i, j\\) )th summand in (1), and for \\(\\ell \\notin\\{i, j\\}\\) the sum of the ( \\(i, \\ell\\) )th and the ( \\(j, \\ell\\) )th summands does not increase by the Lemma. Hence the optimal value does not increase, but the number of disorders in the permutation increases. This process stops when \\(a_{i}=2 k+1-i\\) for all \\(i\\), so the required minimum is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(2 k, 2 k-1, \\ldots, 1) & =\\sum_{1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant 2 k} \\min (\\max (i, j), \\max (2 k+1-i, 2 k+1-j)) \n& =\\sum_{1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant 2 k} \\min (j, 2 k+1-i)\n\n\\]\n\nThe latter sum is fairly tractable and yields the stated result; we omit the details.\nComment. If the number of players is odd, say, \\(2 k-1\\), the required minimum is \\(k(k-1)(4 k-1) / 2\\). In this case, \\(|X|=k,|Y|=k-1\\), the argument goes along the same lines, but some additional technicalities are to be taken care of.\n\nThis page is intentionally left blank"}

In this case (1) yields inductively \\(f(n+k) \\geqslant 2\\) for all \\(k \\geqslant 1\\). But this is absurd: after a finite number of moves, \\(f\\) cannot attain nonzero values at infinitely many points.\n\nSolution 2. We start by showing that the result of the process in the problem does not depend on the way the operations are performed. For that purpose, it is convenient to modify the process a bit.\nClaim 1. Suppose that the board initially contains a finite number of nonnegative integers, and one starts performing type ( \\(i\\) ) moves only. Assume that one had applied \\(k\\) moves which led to a final arrangement where no more type ( \\(i\\) ) moves are possible. Then, if one starts from the same initial arrangement, performing type (i) moves in an arbitrary fashion, then the process will necessarily stop at the same final arrangement\n\nProof. Throughout this proof, all moves are supposed to be of type ( \\(i\\) ).\nInduct on \\(k\\); the base case \\(k=0\\) is trivial, since no moves are possible. Assume now that \\(k \\geqslant 1\\). Fix some canonical process, consisting of \\(k\\) moves \\(M_{1}, M_{2}, \\ldots, M_{k}\\), and reaching the final arrangement \\(A\\). Consider any sample process \\(m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots\\) starting with the same initial arrangement and proceeding as long as possible; clearly, it contains at least one move. We need to show that this process stops at \\(A\\).\n\nLet move \\(m_{1}\\) consist in replacing two copies of \\(x\\) with \\(x+a\\) and \\(x+b\\). If move \\(M_{1}\\) does the same, we may apply the induction hypothesis to the arrangement appearing after \\(m_{1}\\). Otherwise, the canonical process should still contain at least one move consisting in replacing \\((x, x) \\mapsto(x+a, x+b)\\), because the initial arrangement contains at least two copies of \\(x\\), while the final one contains at most one such.\n\nLet \\(M_{i}\\) be the first such move. Since the copies of \\(x\\) are indistinguishable and no other copy of \\(x\\) disappeared before \\(M_{i}\\) in the canonical process, the moves in this process can be permuted as \\(M_{i}, M_{1}, \\ldots, M_{i-1}, M_{i+1}, \\ldots, M_{k}\\), without affecting the final arrangement. Now it suffices to perform the move \\(m_{1}=M_{i}\\) and apply the induction hypothesis as above.\nClaim 2. Consider any process starting from the empty board, which involved exactly \\(n\\) moves of type (ii) and led to a final arrangement where all the numbers are distinct. Assume that one starts with the board containing \\(2 n\\) zeroes (as if \\(n\\) moves of type ( \\(i i\\) ) were made in the beginning), applying type ( \\(i\\) ) moves in an arbitrary way. Then this process will reach the same final arrangement.\nProof. Starting with the board with \\(2 n\\) zeros, one may indeed model the first process mentioned in the statement of the claim, omitting the type ( \\(i i\\) ) moves. This way, one reaches the same final arrangement. Now, Claim 1 yields that this final arrangement will be obtained when type ( \\(i\\) ) moves are applied arbitrarily.\n\nClaim 2 allows now to reformulate the problem statement as follows: There exists an integer \\(n\\) such that, starting from \\(2 n\\) zeroes, one may apply type (i) moves indefinitely.\n\nIn order to prove this, we start with an obvious induction on \\(s+t=k \\geqslant 1\\) to show that if we start with \\(2^{s+t}\\) zeros, then we can get simultaneously on the board, at some point, each of the numbers \\(s a+t b\\), with \\(s+t=k\\).\n\nSuppose now that \\(a<b\\). Then, an appropriate use of separate groups of zeros allows us to get two copies of each of the numbers \\(s a+t b\\), with \\(1 \\leqslant s, t \\leqslant b\\).\n\nDefine \\(N=a b-a-b\\), and notice that after representing each of numbers \\(N+k, 1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant b\\), in the form \\(s a+t b, 1 \\leqslant s, t \\leqslant b\\) we can get, using enough zeros, the numbers \\(N+1, N+2, \\ldots, N+a\\) and the numbers \\(N+1, N+2, \\ldots, N+b\\).\n\nFrom now on we can perform only moves of type ( \\(i\\) ). Indeed, if \\(n \\geqslant N\\), the occurrence of the numbers \\(n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+a\\) and \\(n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+b\\) and the replacement \\((n+1, n+1) \\mapsto\\) \\((n+b+1, n+a+1)\\) leads to the occurrence of the numbers \\(n+2, n+3, \\ldots, n+a+1\\) and \\(n+2, n+3, \\ldots, n+b+1\\).\n\nComment. The proofs of Claims 1 and 2 may be extended in order to show that in fact the number of moves in the canonical process is the same as in an arbitrary sample one."}

If the two colourings agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.\n(India)", "category": "Combinatorics", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2018, "solution": "Letting \\(n=2018\\), we will show that, if every region has at least one non-yellow vertex, then every circle contains at most \\(n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor-2\\) yellow points.

The proof hinges on the two lemmata below.\nLemma 1. Let two circles in the configuration cross at \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are either both yellow or both non-yellow.\nProof. This is because the numbers of interior vertices on the four arcs \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) determine on the two circles have like parities.\n\nIn particular, each circle in the configuration contains an even number of yellow vertices.\nLemma 2. If \\(\\widehat{x y}, \\widehat{y z}\\), and \\(\\widehat{z x}\\) are circular arcs of three pairwise distinct circles in the configuration, then the number of yellow vertices in the set \\(\\{x, y, z\\}\\) is odd.\nProof. Let \\(C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}\\) be the three circles under consideration. Assume, without loss of generality, that \\(C_{2}\\) and \\(C_{3}\\) cross at \\(x, C_{3}\\) and \\(C_{1}\\) cross at \\(y\\), and \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{2}\\) cross at \\(z\\). Let \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}, k_{3}\\) be the numbers of interior vertices on the three circular arcs under consideration. Since each circle in the configuration, different from the \\(C_{i}\\), crosses the cycle \\(\\widetilde{x y} \\cup \\widehat{y z} \\cup \\widehat{z x}\\) at an even number of points (recall that no three circles are concurrent), and self-crossings are counted twice, the sum \\(k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}\\) is even.\n\nLet \\(Z_{1}\\) be the colour \\(z\\) gets from \\(C_{1}\\) and define the other colours similarly. By the preceding, the number of bichromatic pairs in the list \\(\\left(Z_{1}, Y_{1}\\right),\\left(X_{2}, Z_{2}\\right),\\left(Y_{3}, X_{3}\\right)\\) is odd. Since the total number of colour changes in a cycle \\(Z_{1}-Y_{1}-Y_{3}-X_{3}-X_{2}-Z_{2}-Z_{1}\\) is even, the number of bichromatic pairs in the list \\(\\left(X_{2}, X_{3}\\right),\\left(Y_{1}, Y_{3}\\right),\\left(Z_{1}, Z_{2}\\right)\\) is odd, and the lemma follows.\n\nWe are now in a position to prove that (\\textit{) bounds the total number of yellow vertices from below. Refer to Lemma 1 to infer that the \\(k\\) yellow vertices on \\(C\\) pair off to form the pairs of points where \\(C\\) is crossed by \\(k / 2\\) circles in the configuration. By Lemma 2, these circles cross pairwise to account for another \\(2\\binom{k / 2}{2}\\) yellow vertices. Finally, the remaining \\(n-k / 2-1\\) circles in the configuration cross \\(C\\) at non-yellow vertices, by Lemma 1, and Lemma 2 applies again to show that these circles cross pairwise to account for yet another \\(2\\binom{n-k / 2-1}{2}\\) yellow vertices. Consequently, there are at least (}) yellow vertices.\n\nNext, notice that \\(G\\) is a plane graph on \\(n(n-1)\\) degree 4 vertices, having exactly \\(2 n(n-1)\\) edges and exactly \\(n(n-1)+2\\) faces (regions), the outer face inclusive (by Euler's formula for planar graphs).\nLemma 3. Each face of \\(G\\) has equally many red and blue vertices. In particular, each face has an even number of non-yellow vertices.\n\nProof. Trace the boundary of a face once in circular order, and consider the colours each vertex is assigned in the colouring of the two circles that cross at that vertex, to infer that colours of non-yellow vertices alternate.\n\nConsequently, if each region has at least one non-yellow vertex, then it has at least two such. Since each vertex of \\(G\\) has degree 4, consideration of vertex-face incidences shows that \\(G\\) has at least \\(n(n-1) / 2+1\\) non-yellow vertices, and hence at most \\(n(n-1) / 2-1\\) yellow vertices. (In fact, Lemma 3 shows that there are at least \\(n(n-1) / 4+1 / 2\\) red, respectively blue, vertices.)\n\nFinally, recall the lower bound (*) for the total number of yellow vertices in \\(G\\), to write \\(n(n-1) / 2-1 \\geqslant k^{2} / 2-(n-2) k+(n-2)(n-1)\\), and conclude that \\(k \\leqslant n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor-2\\), as claimed in the first paragraph.\n\nSolution 2. The first two lemmata in Solution 1 show that the circles in the configuration split into two classes: Consider any circle \\(C\\) along with all circles that cross \\(C\\) at yellow points to form one class; the remaining circles then form the other class. Lemma 2 shows that any pair of circles in the same class cross at yellow points; otherwise, they cross at non-yellow points.\n\nCall the circles from the two classes white and black, respectively. Call a region yellow if its vertices are all yellow. Let \\(w\\) and \\(b\\) be the numbers of white and black circles, respectively; clearly, \\(w+b=n\\). Assume that \\(w \\geqslant b\\), and that there is no yellow region. Clearly, \\(b \\geqslant 1\\), otherwise each region is yellow. The white circles subdivide the plane into \\(w(w-1)+2\\) larger regions - call them white. The white regions (or rather their boundaries) subdivide each black circle into black arcs. Since there are no yellow regions, each white region contains at least one black arc.\n\nConsider any white region; let it contain \\(t \\geqslant 1\\) black arcs. We claim that the number of points at which these \\(t\\) arcs cross does not exceed \\(t-1\\). To prove this, consider a multigraph whose vertices are these black arcs, two vertices being joined by an edge for each point at which the corresponding arcs cross. If this graph had more than \\(t-1\\) edges, it would contain a cycle, since it has \\(t\\) vertices; this cycle would correspond to a closed contour formed by black sub-arcs, lying inside the region under consideration. This contour would, in turn, define at least one yellow region, which is impossible.\n\nLet \\(t_{i}\\) be the number of black arcs inside the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) white region. The total number of black arcs is \\(\\sum_{i} t_{i}=2 w b\\), and they cross at \\(2\\binom{b}{2}=b(b-1)\\) points. By the preceding,\n\n\\[\nb(b-1) \\leqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{w^{2}-w+2}\\left(t_{i}-1\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{w^{2}-w+2} t_{i}-\\left(w^{2}-w+2\\right)=2 w b-\\left(w^{2}-w+2\\right)\n\\]\n\nor, equivalently, \\((w-b)^{2} \\leqslant w+b-2=n-2\\), which is the case if and only if \\(w-b \\leqslant\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor\\). Consequently, \\(b \\leqslant w \\leqslant(n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor) / 2\\), so there are at most \\(2(w-1) \\leqslant n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor-2\\) yellow vertices on each circle - a contradiction."}

Clearly, the key point \\(Z\\) from the solution above can be introduced in several different ways, e.g., as the second meeting point of the circle \\(C M Y\\) and the line \\(A M\\), or as the second meeting point of the circles \\(C M Y\\) and \\(B M X\\), etc.\n\nFor some of definitions of \\(Z\\) its location is not obvious. For instance, if \\(Z\\) is defined as a common point of \\(A M\\) and the perpendicular through \\(X\\) to \\(P X\\), it is not clear that \\(Z\\) lies on the ray \\(A M\\) beyond \\(M\\). To avoid such slippery details some more restrictions on the construction may be required.\n\nComment 2. Let us discuss a connection to the Miquel point of a cyclic quadrilateral. Set \\(X^{\\prime}=\\) \\(M X \\cap P C, Y^{\\prime}=M Y \\cap P B\\), and \\(Q=X Y \\cap X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}\\) (see the figure below).\n\nWe claim that \\(B C \\| P Q\\). (One way of proving this is the following. Notice that the quadruple of lines \\(P X, P M, P Y, P Q\\) is harmonic, hence the quadruple \\(B, M, C, P Q \\cap B C\\) of their intersection points with \\(B C\\) is harmonic. Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(B C, P Q \\cap B C\\) is an ideal point, i.e., \\(P Q \\| B C\\).)\n\nIt follows from the given equality \\(\\angle P X M=\\angle P Y M\\) that the quadrilateral \\(X Y X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}\\) is cyclic. Note that \\(A\\) is the projection of \\(M\\) onto \\(P Q\\). By a known description, \\(A\\) is the Miquel point for the sidelines \\(X Y, X Y^{\\prime}, X^{\\prime} Y, X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}\\). In particular, the circle \\(P X Y\\) passes through \\(A\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_b62628dbd164bd27ffa8g-41}\n\nComment 3. An alternative approach is the following. One can note that the (oriented) lengths of the segments \\(C Y\\) and \\(B X\\) are both linear functions of a parameter \\(t=\\cot \\angle P X M\\). As \\(t\\) varies, the intersection point \\(S\\) of the perpendicular bisectors of \\(P X\\) and \\(P Y\\) traces a fixed line, thus the family of circles \\(P X Y\\) has a fixed common point (other than \\(P\\) ). By checking particular cases, one can show that this fixed point is \\(A\\).\n\nComment 4. The problem states that \\(\\angle P X M=\\angle P Y M\\) implies that \\(A P X Y\\) is cyclic. The original submission claims that these two conditions are in fact equivalent. The Problem Selection Committee omitted the converse part, since it follows easily from the direct one, by reversing arguments."}

Therefore, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\left(1+a_{i, j}\\right) \\equiv 1+\\sum_{(i, j)} a_{i, j} & +\\sum_{\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right)} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}} \n& +\\sum_{\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right),\\left(i_{3}, j_{3}\\right)} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}} a_{i_{3}, j_{3}} \\quad\\left(\\bmod n^{4}\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nwhere the last two sums are taken over all unordered pairs/triples of pairwise different pairs \\((i, j)\\); such conventions are applied throughout the solution.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\left(1+a_{i, j}\\right) \\equiv n+\\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} a_{i, j}+\\sum_{i} \\sum_{j_{1}, j_{2}} a_{i, j_{1}} a_{i, j_{2}}+\\sum_{i} \\sum_{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}} a_{i, j_{1}} a_{i, j_{2}} a_{i, j_{3}} \\quad\\left(\\bmod n^{4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP+(n-1)-\\sum_{i} R_{i} \\equiv \\sum_{\\substack{\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right) \ni_{1} \\neq i_{2}}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}} & +\\sum_{\\substack{\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right),\\left(i_{3}, j_{3}\\right) \ni_{1} \\neq i_{2} \\neq i_{3} \\neq i_{1}}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}} a_{i_{3}, j_{3}} \n& +\\sum_{\\substack{\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right),\\left(i_{3}, j_{3}\\right) \ni_{1} \\neq i_{2}=i_{3}}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}} a_{i_{3}, j_{3}} \\quad\\left(\\bmod n^{4}\\right) .\n\n\\]\n\nWe show that in fact each of the three sums appearing in the right-hand part of this congruence is divisible by \\(n^{4}\\); this yields (1). Denote those three sums by \\(\\Sigma_{1}, \\Sigma_{2}\\), and \\(\\Sigma_{3}\\) in order of appearance. Recall that by condition (ii) we have\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j} a_{i, j} \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod n^{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { for all indices } i\n\\]\n\nFor every two indices \\(i_{1}<i_{2}\\) we have\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j_{1}} \\sum_{j_{2}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}}=\\left(\\sum_{j_{1}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\sum_{j_{2}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}}\\right) \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod n^{4}\\right),\n\\]\n\nsince each of the two factors is divisible by \\(n^{2}\\). Summing over all pairs ( \\(i_{1}, i_{2}\\) ) we obtain \\(n^{4} \\mid \\Sigma_{1}\\).\nSimilarly, for every three indices \\(i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}\\) we have\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j_{1}} \\sum_{j_{2}} \\sum_{j_{3}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}} a_{i_{3}, j_{3}}=\\left(\\sum_{j_{1}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\sum_{j_{2}} a_{i_{2}, j_{2}}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\sum_{j_{3}} a_{i_{3}, j_{3}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhich is divisible even by \\(n^{6}\\). Hence \\(n^{4} \\mid \\Sigma_{2}\\).\nFinally, for every indices \\(i_{1} \\neq i_{2}=i_{3}\\) and \\(j_{2}<j_{3}\\) we have\n\n\\[\na_{i_{2}, j_{2}} \\cdot a_{i_{2}, j_{3}} \\cdot \\sum_{j_{1}} a_{i_{1}, j_{1}} \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod n^{4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nsince the three factors are divisible by \\(n, n\\), and \\(n^{2}\\), respectively. Summing over all 4 -tuples of indices \\(\\left(i_{1}, i_{2}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right)\\) we get \\(n^{4} \\mid \\Sigma_{3}\\)."}

Assume that \\(b\\) is a positive integer such that \\(S_{n-1}-a_{n}<b<a_{n}\\) for some \\(n \\geqslant 3\\). Then \\(b \\sim S_{n-1}-b\\).\nProof. As seen above, we have \\(S_{n-1}>a_{n}\\).

The converse is obtained by swapping \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\nWe also need the following version of this claim.\nClaim 2. For any \\(n \\geqslant 3\\), the number \\(a_{n}\\) can be represented as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence if and only if \\(S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{\\lceil n / 2\\rceil}-3\\) is representable.\nProof. Denote \\(c=S_{n-1}-a_{n}<a_{n}\\). If \\(a_{n}\\) satisfies the required condition, then it is the sum of some subset of \\(\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}\\); then \\(c\\) is the sum of the complement. Conversely, if \\(c\\) is representable, then its representation consists only of the numbers from \\(\\left\\{a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}\\), so \\(a_{n}\\) is the sum of the complement.\n\nBy Claim 2, in order to prove the problem statement, it suffices to find infinitely many representable numbers of the form \\(2^{t}-3\\), as well as infinitely many non-representable ones.\nClaim 3. For every \\(t \\geqslant 3\\), we have \\(2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3\\), and \\(2^{4 t-6}-3>2^{t}-3\\).\nProof. The inequality follows from \\(t \\geqslant 3\\). In order to prove the equivalence, we apply Claim 1 twice in the following manner.\n\nFirst, since \\(S_{2 t-3}-a_{2 t-2}=2^{t-1}-3<2^{t}-3<2^{2 t-2}+2^{t-1}=a_{2 t-2}\\), by Claim 1 we have \\(2^{t}-3 \\sim S_{2 t-3}-\\left(2^{t}-3\\right)=2^{2 t-2}\\).\n\nSecond, since \\(S_{4 t-7}-a_{4 t-6}=2^{2 t-3}-3<2^{2 t-2}<2^{4 t-6}+2^{2 t-3}=a_{4 t-6}\\), by Claim 1 we have \\(2^{2 t-2} \\sim S_{4 t-7}-2^{2 t-2}=2^{4 t-6}-3\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{2 t-2} \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3\\), as required.\nNow it is easy to find the required numbers. Indeed, the number \\(2^{3}-3=5=a_{0}+a_{1}\\) is representable, so Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of representable numbers\n\n\\[\n2^{3}-3 \\sim 2^{6}-3 \\sim 2^{18}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots .\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, the number \\(2^{7}-3=125\\) is non-representable (since by Claim 1 we have \\(125 \\sim S_{6}-125=24 \\sim S_{4}-24=17 \\sim S_{3}-17=4\\) which is clearly non-representable). So Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of non-representable numbers\n\n\\[\n2^{7}-3 \\sim 2^{22}-3 \\sim 2^{82}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots\n\\]\n\nSolution 2. We keep the notion of representability and the notation \\(S_{n}\\) from the previous solution. We say that an index \\(n\\) is good if \\(a_{n}\\) writes as a sum of smaller terms from the sequence \\(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\). Otherwise we say it is bad. We must prove that there are infinitely many good indices, as well as infinitely many bad ones.\nLemma 1. If \\(m \\geqslant 0\\) is an integer, then \\(4^{m}\\) is representable if and only if either of \\(2 m+1\\) and \\(2 m+2\\) is good.\n\nProof. The case \\(m=0\\) is obvious, so we may assume that \\(m \\geqslant 1\\). Let \\(n=2 m+1\\) or \\(2 m+2\\). Then \\(n \\geqslant 3\\). We notice that\n\n\\[\nS_{n-1}<a_{n-2}+a_{n}\n\\]\n\nThe inequality writes as \\(2^{n}+2^{\\lceil n / 2\\rceil}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}-3<2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}+2^{n-2}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor-1}\\), i.e. as \\(2^{\\lceil n / 2\\rceil}<\\) \\(2^{n-2}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor-1}+3\\). If \\(n \\geqslant 4\\), then \\(n / 2 \\leqslant n-2\\), so \\(\\lceil n / 2\\rceil \\leqslant n-2\\) and \\(2^{\\lceil n / 2\\rceil} \\leqslant 2^{n-2}\\). For \\(n=3\\) the inequality verifies separately.\n\nIf \\(n\\) is good, then \\(a_{n}\\) writes as \\(a_{n}=a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}}\\), where \\(r \\geqslant 2\\) and \\(i_{1}<\\cdots<i_{r}<n\\). Then \\(i_{r}=n-1\\) and \\(i_{r-1}=n-2\\), for if \\(n-1\\) or \\(n-2\\) is missing from the sequence \\(i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r}\\), then \\(a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}} \\leqslant a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{n-3}+a_{n-1}=S_{n-1}-a_{n-2}<a_{n}\\). Thus, if \\(n\\) is good, then both \\(a_{n}-a_{n-1}\\) and \\(a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}\\) are representable.\n\nWe now consider the cases \\(n=2 m+1\\) and \\(n=2 m+2\\) separately.\nIf \\(n=2 m+1\\), then \\(a_{n}-a_{n-1}=a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+1}+2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}\\). So we proved that, if \\(2 m+1\\) is good, then \\(2^{2 m}\\) is representable. Conversely, if \\(2^{2 m}\\) is representable, then \\(2^{2 m}<a_{2 m}\\), so \\(2^{2 m}\\) is a sum of some distinct terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i<2 m\\). It follows that \\(a_{2 m+1}=a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}\\) writes as \\(a_{2 m}\\) plus a sum of some distinct terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i<2 m\\). Hence \\(2 m+1\\) is good.\n\nIf \\(n=2 m+2\\), then \\(a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}=a_{2 m+2}-a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+2}+2^{m+1}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m+1}+\\right.\\) \\(\\left.2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}\\). So we proved that, if \\(2 m+2\\) is good, then \\(2^{2 m}\\) is representable. Conversely, if \\(2^{2 m}\\) is representable, then, as seen in the previous case, it writes as a sum of some distinct terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i<2 m\\). Hence \\(a_{2 m+2}=a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}\\) writes as \\(a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}\\) plus a sum of some distinct terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i<2 m\\). Thus \\(2 m+2\\) is good.\n\nLemma 2. If \\(k \\geqslant 2\\), then \\(2^{4 k-2}\\) is representable if and only if \\(2^{k+1}\\) is representable.\nIn particular, if \\(s \\geqslant 2\\), then \\(4^{s}\\) is representable if and only if \\(4^{4 s-3}\\) is representable. Also, \\(4^{4 s-3}>4^{s}\\).\n\nProof. We have \\(2^{4 k-2}<a_{4 k-2}\\), so in a representation of \\(2^{4 k-2}\\) we can have only terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i \\leqslant 4 k-3\\). Notice that\n\n\\[\na_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}=2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3<2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}+2^{k}=2^{4 k-2}+a_{2 k}\n\\]\n\nHence, any representation of \\(2^{4 k-2}\\) must contain all terms from \\(a_{2 k}\\) to \\(a_{4 k-3}\\). (If any of these terms is missing, then the sum of the remaining ones is \\(\\leqslant\\left(a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}\\right)-a_{2 k}<2^{4 k-2}\\).) Hence, if \\(2^{4 k-2}\\) is representable, then \\(2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}\\) is representable. But\n\\(2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(S_{4 k-3}-S_{2 k-1}\\right)=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3\\right)+\\left(2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3\\right)=2^{k+1}\\).\nSo, if \\(2^{4 k-2}\\) is representable, then \\(2^{k+1}\\) is representable. Conversely, if \\(2^{k+1}\\) is representable, then \\(2^{k+1}<2^{2 k}+2^{k}=a_{2 k}\\), so \\(2^{k+1}\\) writes as a sum of some distinct terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i<2 k\\). It follows that \\(2^{4 k-2}=\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}+2^{k+1}\\) writes as \\(a_{4 k-3}+a_{4 k-4}+\\cdots+a_{2 k}\\) plus the sum of some distinct terms \\(a_{i}\\) with \\(i<2 k\\). Hence \\(2^{4 k-2}\\) is representable.\n\nFor the second statement, if \\(s \\geqslant 2\\), then we just take \\(k=2 s-1\\) and we notice that \\(2^{k+1}=4^{s}\\) and \\(2^{4 k-2}=4^{4 s-3}\\). Also, \\(s \\geqslant 2\\) implies that \\(4 s-3>s\\).\n\nNow \\(4^{2}=a_{2}+a_{3}\\) is representable, whereas \\(4^{6}=4096\\) is not. Indeed, note that \\(4^{6}=2^{12}<a_{12}\\), so the only available terms for a representation are \\(a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}\\), i.e., \\(2,3,6,10,20,36,72\\), 136, 272, 528, 1056, 2080. Their sum is \\(S_{11}=4221\\), which exceeds 4096 by 125. Then any representation of 4096 must contain all the terms from \\(a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}\\) that are greater that 125 , i.e., \\(136,272,528,1056,2080\\). Their sum is 4072 . Since \\(4096-4072=24\\) and 24 is clearly not representable, 4096 is non-representable as well.\n\nStarting with these values of \\(m\\), by using Lemma 2, we can obtain infinitely many representable powers of 4, as well as infinitely many non-representable ones. By Lemma 1, this solves our problem.\n\nThis page is intentionally left blank"}

This means that \\(a_{n} \\mid a_{1}^{n-k} a_{k}\\), so all prime divisors of \\(a_{n}\\) are among those of \\(a_{1} a_{k}\\). There are finitely many such primes; therefore, it suffices to prove that the exponent of each of them in the prime factorization of \\(a_{n}\\) is eventually constant.\n\nChoose any prime \\(p \\mid a_{1} a_{k}\\). Recall that \\(v_{p}(q)\\) is the standard notation for the exponent of \\(p\\) in the prime factorization of a nonzero rational number \\(q\\). Say that an index \\(n \\geqslant k\\) is large if \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right) \\geqslant v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right)\\). We separate two cases.\nCase 1: There exists a large index \\(n\\).\nIf \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right)<v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right)\\), then \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n} / a_{n+1}\\right)\\) and \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n} / a_{1}\\right)\\) are nonnegative, while \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1} / a_{1}\\right)<0\\); hence (*) cannot be an integer. This contradiction shows that index \\(n+1\\) is also large.\n\nOn the other hand, if \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right)>v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\), then \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n} / a_{n+1}\\right)<0\\), while \\(v_{p}\\left(\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{n}\\right) / a_{1}\\right) \\geqslant 0\\), so (*) is not integer again. Thus, \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right) \\leqslant v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right) \\leqslant v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\).\n\nThe above arguments can now be applied successively to indices \\(n+1, n+2, \\ldots\\), showing that all the indices greater than \\(n\\) are large, and the sequence \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right), v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right), v_{p}\\left(a_{n+2}\\right), \\ldots\\) is nonincreasing - hence eventually constant.\n\nCase 2: There is no large index.\nWe have \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right)>v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\) for all \\(n \\geqslant k\\). If we had \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right)<v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\) for some \\(n \\geqslant k\\), then \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1} / a_{1}\\right)<v_{p}\\left(a_{n} / a_{1}\\right)<0<v_{p}\\left(a_{n} / a_{n+1}\\right)\\) which would also yield that \\((*)\\) is not integer. Therefore, in this case the sequence \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{k}\\right), v_{p}\\left(a_{k+1}\\right), v_{p}\\left(a_{k+2}\\right), \\ldots\\) is nondecreasing and bounded by \\(v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right)\\) from above; hence it is also eventually constant.\n\nComment. Given any positive odd integer \\(m\\), consider the \\(m\\)-tuple ( \\(2,2^{2}, \\ldots, 2^{m-1}, 2^{m}\\) ). Appending an infinite string of 1's to this \\(m\\)-tuple yields an eventually constant sequence of integers satisfying the condition in the statement, and shows that the rank from which the sequence stabilises may be arbitrarily large.\n\nThere are more sophisticated examples.

Letting \\(a_{m+k}=a_{1}, k=1,2, \\ldots\\), extends such an \\(m\\)-tuple to an eventually constant sequence of positive integers satisfying the condition in the statement of the problem at hand.\n\nHere is the example given by the proposers of 10532. Let \\(b_{1}=2\\), let \\(b_{k+1}=1+b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}=\\) \\(1+b_{k}\\left(b_{k}-1\\right), k \\geqslant 1\\), and set \\(B_{m}=b_{1} \\cdots b_{m-4}=b_{m-3}-1\\). The \\(m\\)-tuple ( \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{m}\\) ) defined below satisfies the required conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{1}=1, & a_{2}=\\left(8 B_{m}+1\\right) B_{m}+8, \\quad a_{3}=8 B_{m}+1, \\quad a_{k}=b_{m-k} \\quad \\text { for } 4 \\leqslant k \\leqslant m-1, \n& a_{m}=\\frac{a_{2}}{2} \\cdot a_{3} \\cdot \\frac{B_{m}}{2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(8 B_{m}+1\\right) B_{m}+4\\right) \\cdot\\left(8 B_{m}+1\\right) \\cdot \\frac{B_{m}}{2}\n\n\\]\n\nIt is readily checked that \\(a_{1}<a_{m-1}<a_{m-2}<\\cdots<a_{3}<a_{2}<a_{m}\\). For further details we refer to the solution mentioned above. Acquaintance with this example (or more elaborated examples derived from) offers no advantage in tackling the problem."}

Four positive integers \\(x, y, z\\), and \\(t\\) satisfy the relations\n\n\\[\nx y-z t=x+y=z+t .\n\\]\n\nIs it possible that both \\(x y\\) and \\(z t\\) are perfect squares?\n(Russia)\nAnswer: No.", "category": "Number Theory", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2018, "solution": "Arguing indirectly, assume that \\(x y=a^{2}\\) and \\(z t=c^{2}\\) with \\(a, c>0\\).\nSuppose that the number \\(x+y=z+t\\) is odd. Then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have opposite parity, as well as \\(z\\) and \\(t\\). This means that both \\(x y\\) and \\(z t\\) are even, as well as \\(x y-z t=x+y\\); a contradiction. Thus, \\(x+y\\) is even, so the number \\(s=\\frac{x+y}{2}=\\frac{z+t}{2}\\) is a positive integer.\n\nNext, we set \\(b=\\frac{|x-y|}{2}, d=\\frac{|z-t|}{2}\\). Now the problem conditions yield\n\n\\[\ns^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}+d^{2}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n2 s=a^{2}-c^{2}=d^{2}-b^{2}\n\\]\n\n(the last equality in (2) follows from (1)). We readily get from (2) that \\(a, d>0\\).\nIn the sequel we will use only the relations (1) and (2), along with the fact that \\(a, d, s\\) are positive integers, while \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are nonnegative integers, at most one of which may be zero. Since both relations are symmetric with respect to the simultaneous swappings \\(a \\leftrightarrow d\\) and \\(b \\leftrightarrow c\\), we assume, without loss of generality, that \\(b \\geqslant c\\) (and hence \\(b>0\\) ). Therefore, \\(d^{2}=2 s+b^{2}>c^{2}\\), whence\n\n\\[\nd^{2}>\\frac{c^{2}+d^{2}}{2}=\\frac{s^{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, since \\(d^{2}-b^{2}\\) is even by (2), the numbers \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) have the same parity, so \\(0<b \\leqslant d-2\\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\n2 s=d^{2}-b^{2} \\geqslant d^{2}-(d-2)^{2}=4(d-1), \\quad \\text { i.e., } \\quad d \\leqslant \\frac{s}{2}+1\n\\]\n\nCombining (3) and (4) we obtain\n\n\\[\n2 s^{2}<4 d^{2} \\leqslant 4\\left(\\frac{s}{2}+1\\right)^{2}, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad(s-2)^{2}<8\n\\]\n\nwhich yields \\(s \\leqslant 4\\).\nFinally, an easy check shows that each number of the form \\(s^{2}\\) with \\(1 \\leqslant s \\leqslant 4\\) has a unique representation as a sum of two squares, namely \\(s^{2}=s^{2}+0^{2}\\). Thus, (1) along with \\(a, d>0\\) imply \\(b=c=0\\), which is impossible.\n\nSolution 2. We start with a complete description of all 4-tuples ( \\(x, y, z, t\\) ) of positive integers satisfying (*). As in the solution above, we notice that the numbers\n\n\\[\ns=\\frac{x+y}{2}=\\frac{z+t}{2}, \\quad p=\\frac{x-y}{2}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad q=\\frac{z-t}{2}\n\\]\n\nare integers (we may, and will, assume that \\(p, q \\geqslant 0\\) ). We have\n\n\\[\n2 s=x y-z t=(s+p)(s-p)-(s+q)(s-q)=q^{2}-p^{2},\n\\]\n\nso \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have the same parity, and \\(q>p\\).\n\nSet now \\(k=\\frac{q-p}{2}, \\ell=\\frac{q+p}{2}\\). Then we have \\(s=\\frac{q^{2}-p^{2}}{2}=2 k \\ell\\) and hence\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nx=s+p=2 k \\ell-k+\\ell, & y=s-p=2 k \\ell+k-\\ell \nz=s+q=2 k \\ell+k+\\ell, & t=s-q=2 k \\ell-k-\\ell\n\n\\]\n\nRecall here that \\(\\ell \\geqslant k>0\\) and, moreover, \\((k, \\ell) \\neq(1,1)\\), since otherwise \\(t=0\\).\nAssume now that both \\(x y\\) and \\(z t\\) are squares. Then \\(x y z t\\) is also a square. On the other hand, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx y z t=(2 k \\ell-k+\\ell) & (2 k \\ell+k-\\ell)(2 k \\ell+k+\\ell)(2 k \\ell-k-\\ell) \n= & \\left(4 k^{2} \\ell^{2}-(k-\\ell)^{2}\\right)\\left(4 k^{2} \\ell^{2}-(k+\\ell)^{2}\\right)=\\left(4 k^{2} \\ell^{2}-k^{2}-\\ell^{2}\\right)^{2}-4 k^{2} \\ell^{2} .\n\n\\]\n\nDenote \\(D=4 k^{2} \\ell^{2}-k^{2}-\\ell^{2}>0\\). From (6) we get \\(D^{2}>x y z t\\). On the other hand,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(D-1)^{2}=D^{2}-2\\left(4 k^{2} \\ell^{2}-k^{2}-\\ell^{2}\\right)+1=\\left(D^{2}-4 k^{2} \\ell^{2}\\right)-\\left(2 k^{2}-1\\right)\\left(2 \\ell^{2}-1\\right)+2 \n&=x y z t-\\left(2 k^{2}-1\\right)\\left(2 \\ell^{2}-1\\right)+2<x y z t\n\n\\]\n\nsince \\(\\ell \\geqslant 2\\) and \\(k \\geqslant 1\\). Thus \\((D-1)^{2}<x y z t<D^{2}\\), and \\(x y z t\\) cannot be a perfect square; a contradiction.\n\nComment. The first part of Solution 2 shows that all 4-tuples of positive integers \\(x \\geqslant y, z \\geqslant t\\) satisfying (\\textit{) have the form (5), where \\(\\ell \\geqslant k>0\\) and \\(\\ell \\geqslant 2\\). The converse is also true: every pair of positive integers \\(\\ell \\geqslant k>0\\), except for the pair \\(k=\\ell=1\\), generates via (5) a 4 -tuple of positive integers satisfying (})."}

Since the function \\(f\\) is bounded, there are only a finite number of primes that divide at least one \\(f(n)\\); so altogether there are finitely many numbers \\(n\\) such that \\(f(n)\\) has a sporadic prime divisor. Let \\(N\\) be a positive integer, greater than all those numbers \\(n\\).\n\nLet \\(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{k}\\) be the frequent primes.

Since \\(1 \\in S_{a}\\), by the lemma it suffices to prove that \\(S_{a}\\) is an infinite set.\nCall a positive integer \\(p\\) a peak if \\(f(p)>\\max (f(1), \\ldots, f(p-1))\\). Since \\(f\\) is not bounded, there are infinitely many peaks. Let \\(1=p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots\\) be the sequence of all peaks, and let \\(h_{k}=f\\left(p_{k}\\right)\\). Notice that for any peak \\(p_{i}\\) and for any \\(k<p_{i}\\), we have \\(f\\left(p_{i}\\right) \\mid f(k)+f\\left(p_{i}-k\\right)<\\) \\(2 f\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\), hence\n\n\\[\nf(k)+f\\left(p_{i}-k\\right)=f\\left(p_{i}\\right)=h_{i}\n\\]\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, among the numbers \\(h_{1}, h_{2}, \\ldots\\) there are infinitely many that are congruent modulo \\(a\\).

This provides infinitely many elements in \\(S_{a}\\).\nHence, \\(S_{a}\\) is an infinite set, and therefore \\(f(1)=a\\) divides \\(f(n)\\) for every \\(n\\).\n\nComment. As an extension of the solution above, it can be proven that if \\(f\\) is not bounded then \\(f(n)=a n\\) with \\(a=f(1)\\).\n\nTake an arbitrary positive integer \\(n\\); we will show that \\(f(n+1)=f(n)+a\\). Then it follows by induction that \\(f(n)=a n\\).\n\nTake a peak \\(p\\) such that \\(p>n+2\\) and \\(h=f(p)>f(n)+2 a\\). By (1) we have \\(f(p-1)=\\) \\(f(p)-f(1)=h-a\\) and \\(f(n+1)=f(p)-f(p-n-1)=h-f(p-n-1)\\). From \\(h-a=f(p-1) \\mid\\) \\(f(n)+f(p-n-1)<f(n)+h<2(h-a)\\) we get \\(f(n)+f(p-n-1)=h-a\\).

Let \\(d_{n}=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(n), f(1))\\). From \\(d_{n+1} \\mid f(1)\\) and \\(d_{n+1}|f(n+1)| f(n)+f(1)\\), we can see that \\(d_{n+1} \\mid f(n)\\); then \\(d_{n+1} \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(f(n), f(1))=d_{n}\\). So the sequence \\(d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots\\) is nonincreasing in the sense that every element is a divisor of the previous elements. Let \\(d=\\min \\left(d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(d_{1} . d_{2}, \\ldots\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(1), f(2), \\ldots)\\); we have to prove \\(d \\geqslant 2\\).\n\nFor the sake of contradiction, suppose that the statement is wrong, so \\(d=1\\); that means there is some index \\(n_{0}\\) such that \\(d_{n}=1\\) for every \\(n \\geqslant n_{0}\\), i.e., \\(f(n)\\) is coprime with \\(f(1)\\).\nClaim 1. If \\(2^{k} \\geqslant n_{0}\\) then \\(f\\left(2^{k}\\right) \\leqslant 2^{k}\\).\nProof. By the condition, \\(f(2 n) \\mid 2 f(n)\\); a trivial induction yields \\(f\\left(2^{k}\\right) \\mid 2^{k} f(1)\\). If \\(2^{k} \\geqslant n_{0}\\) then \\(f\\left(2^{k}\\right)\\) is coprime with \\(f(1)\\), so \\(f\\left(2^{k}\\right)\\) is a divisor of \\(2^{k}\\).\nClaim 2. There is a constant \\(C\\) such that \\(f(n)<n+C\\) for every \\(n\\).\nProof. Take the first power of 2 which is greater than or equal to \\(n_{0}\\) : let \\(K=2^{k} \\geqslant n_{0}\\). By Claim 1, we have \\(f(K) \\leqslant K\\). Notice that \\(f(n+K) \\mid f(n)+f(K)\\) implies \\(f(n+K) \\leqslant\\) \\(f(n)+f(K) \\leqslant f(n)+K\\). If \\(n=t K+r\\) for some \\(t \\geqslant 0\\) and \\(1 \\leqslant r \\leqslant K\\), then we conclude\n\\(f(n) \\leqslant K+f(n-K) \\leqslant 2 K+f(n-2 K) \\leqslant \\ldots \\leqslant t K+f(r)<n+\\max (f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(K))\\),\nso the claim is true with \\(C=\\max (f(1), \\ldots, f(K))\\).\nClaim 3. If \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\) are coprime then \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(a), f(b)) \\mid f(1)\\). In particular, if \\(a, b \\geqslant n_{0}\\) are coprime then \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\) are coprime.\nProof. Let \\(d=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(a), f(b))\\). We can replicate Euclid's algorithm. Formally, apply induction on \\(a+b\\). If \\(a=1\\) or \\(b=1\\) then we already have \\(d \\mid f(1)\\).\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose \\(1<a<b\\). Then \\(d \\mid f(a)\\) and \\(d|f(b)| f(a)+f(b-a)\\), so \\(d \\mid f(b-a)\\). Therefore \\(d\\) divides \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(a), f(b-a))\\) which is a divisor of \\(f(1)\\) by the induction hypothesis.\n\nLet \\(p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots\\) be the sequence of all prime numbers; for every \\(k\\), let \\(q_{k}\\) be the lowest power of \\(p_{k}\\) with \\(q_{k} \\geqslant n_{0}\\). (Notice that there are only finitely many positive integers with \\(q_{k} \\neq p_{k}\\).)\n\nTake a positive integer \\(N\\), and consider the numbers\n\n\\[\nf(1), f\\left(q_{1}\\right), f\\left(q_{2}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(q_{N}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere we have \\(N+1\\) numbers, each being greater than 1 , and they are pairwise coprime by Claim 3. Therefore, they have at least \\(N+1\\) different prime divisors in total, and their greatest prime divisor is at least \\(p_{N+1}\\). Hence, \\(\\max \\left(f(1), f\\left(q_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(q_{N}\\right)\\right) \\geqslant p_{N+1}\\).\n\nChoose \\(N\\) such that \\(\\max \\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{N}\\right)=p_{N}\\) (this is achieved if \\(N\\) is sufficiently large), and \\(p_{N+1}-p_{N}>C\\) (that is possible, because there are arbitrarily long gaps between the primes). Then we establish a contradiction\n\n\\[\np_{N+1} \\leqslant \\max \\left(f(1), f\\left(q_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(q_{N}\\right)\\right)<\\max \\left(1+C, q_{1}+C, \\ldots, q_{N}+C\\right)=p_{N}+C<p_{N+1}\n\\]\n\nwhich proves the statement."}

Substituting \\(x=0\\) and \\(y=f(0)\\) into (1) we learn that the number \\(z=-f(f(0))\\) satisfies \\(f(z)=-1\\). So by plugging \\(y=z\\) into (1) we deduce that\n\n\\[\nf(x+1)=f(f(x))\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Thereby (1) simplifies to\n\n\\[\nf(x-f(y))=f(x+1)-f(y)-1\n\\]\n\nWe now work towards showing that \\(f\\) is linear by contemplating the difference \\(f(x+1)-f(x)\\) for any \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).

The second equation leads to \\(A=0\\) or \\(A=1\\). In case \\(A=1\\), the first equation gives \\(B=1\\), meaning that \\(f\\) has to be the successor function. If \\(A=0\\), then \\(f\\) is constant and (1) shows that its constant value has to be -1 . Thereby the solution is complete.\n\nComment. After (2) and (3) have been obtained, there are several other ways to combine them so as to obtain linearity properties of \\(f\\). For instance, using (2) thrice in a row and then (3) with \\(x=f(y)\\) one may deduce that\n\n\\[\nf(y+2)=f(f(y+1))=f(f(f(y)))=f(f(y)+1)=f(y)+f(0)+1\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\(y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). It follows that \\(f\\) behaves linearly on the even numbers and on the odd numbers separately, and moreover that the slopes of these two linear functions coincide. From this point, one may complete the solution with some straightforward case analysis.\n\nA different approach using the equations (2) and (3) will be presented in Solution 2. To show that it is also possible to start in a completely different way, we will also present a third solution that avoids these equations entirely.\n\nSolution 2. We commence by deriving (2) and (3) as in the first solution. Now provided that \\(f\\) is injective, (2) tells us that \\(f\\) is the successor function. Thus we may assume from now on that \\(f\\) is not injective, i.e., that there are two integers \\(a>b\\) with \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have \\(f(a+n)=f(b+n)\\) for all nonnegative integers \\(n\\). Consequently, the sequence \\(\\gamma_{n}=f(b+n)\\) is periodic and thus in particular bounded, which means that the numbers\n\n\\[\n\\varphi=\\min _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\psi=\\max _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n}\n\\]\n\nexist.\nLet us pick any integer \\(y\\) with \\(f(y)=\\varphi\\) and then an integer \\(x \\geqslant a\\) with \\(f(x-f(y))=\\varphi\\). Due to the definition of \\(\\varphi\\) and (3) we have\n\n\\[\n\\varphi \\leqslant f(x+1)=f(x-f(y))+f(y)+1=2 \\varphi+1\n\\]\n\nwhence \\(\\varphi \\geqslant-1\\). The same reasoning applied to \\(\\psi\\) yields \\(\\psi \\leqslant-1\\). Since \\(\\varphi \\leqslant \\psi\\) holds trivially, it follows that \\(\\varphi=\\psi=-1\\), or in other words that we have \\(f(t)=-1\\) for all integers \\(t \\geqslant a\\).\n\nFinally, if any integer \\(y\\) is given, we may find an integer \\(x\\) which is so large that \\(x+1 \\geqslant a\\) and \\(x-f(y) \\geqslant a\\) hold. Due to (3) and the result from the previous paragraph we get\n\n\\[\nf(y)=f(x+1)-f(x-f(y))-1=(-1)-(-1)-1=-1\n\\]\n\nThereby the problem is solved.\nSolution 3. Set \\(d=f(0)\\). By plugging \\(x=f(y)\\) into (1) we obtain\n\n\\[\nf^{3}(y)=f(y)+d+1\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), where the left-hand side abbreviates \\(f(f(f(y)))\\). When we replace \\(x\\) in (1) by \\(f(x)\\) we obtain \\(f(f(x)-f(y))=f^{3}(x)-f(y)-1\\) and as a consequence of (4) this simplifies to\n\n\\[\nf(f(x)-f(y))=f(x)-f(y)+d\n\\]\n\nNow we consider the set\n\n\\[\nE=\\{f(x)-d \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\n\\]\n\nGiven two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from \\(E\\), we may pick some integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) with \\(f(x)=a+d\\) and \\(f(y)=b+d\\); now (5) tells us that \\(f(a-b)=(a-b)+d\\), which means that \\(a-b\\) itself exemplifies \\(a-b \\in E\\). Thus,\n\n\\[\nE \\text { is closed under taking differences. }\n\\]\n\nAlso, the definitions of \\(d\\) and \\(E\\) yield \\(0 \\in E\\). If \\(E=\\{0\\}\\), then \\(f\\) is a constant function and (1) implies that the only value attained by \\(f\\) is indeed -1 .\n\nSo let us henceforth suppose that \\(E\\) contains some number besides zero. It is known that in this case (6) entails \\(E\\) to be the set of all integer multiples of some positive integer \\(k\\). Indeed, this holds for\n\n\\[\nk=\\min \\{|x| \\mid x \\in E \\text { and } x \\neq 0\\}\n\\]\n\nas one may verify by an argument based on division with remainder.\nThus we have\n\n\\[\n\\{f(x) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}=\\{k \\cdot t+d \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} .\n\\]\n\nDue to (5) and (7) we get\n\n\\[\nf(k \\cdot t)=k \\cdot t+d\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), whence in particular \\(f(k)=k+d\\). So by comparing the results of substituting \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=k\\) into (1) we learn that\n\n\\[\nf(z+k)=f(z)+k\n\\]\n\nholds for all integers \\(z\\). In plain English, this means that on any residue class modulo \\(k\\) the function \\(f\\) is linear with slope 1 .\n\nNow by (7) the set of all values attained by \\(f\\) is such a residue class. Hence, there exists an absolute constant \\(c\\) such that \\(f(f(x))=f(x)+c\\) holds for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Thereby (1) simplifies to\n\n\\[\nf(x-f(y))=f(x)-f(y)+c-1\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, considering (1) modulo \\(k\\) we obtain \\(d \\equiv-1(\\bmod k)\\) because of (7). So by (7) again, \\(f\\) attains the value -1 .\n\nThus we may apply (9) to some integer \\(y\\) with \\(f(y)=-1\\), which gives \\(f(x+1)=f(x)+c\\). So \\(f\\) is a linear function with slope \\(c\\). Hence, (8) leads to \\(c=1\\), wherefore there is an absolute constant \\(d^{\\prime}\\) with \\(f(x)=x+d^{\\prime}\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Using this for \\(x=0\\) we obtain \\(d^{\\prime}=d\\) and finally (4) discloses \\(d=1\\), meaning that \\(f\\) is indeed the successor function."}

Therefore, the maximum possible value of \\(Z\\) is \\(n(n-1)\\), as desired.\n\nComment 1. \\(Z=n(n-1)\\) can be achieved by several other examples. In particular, \\(x_{i}\\) needs not be \\(\\pm 1\\). For instance, setting \\(x_{i}=(-1)^{i}\\) for all \\(2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 2 n\\), we find that the coefficient of \\(x_{1}\\) in \\(Z\\) is 0 . Therefore, \\(x_{1}\\) can be chosen arbitrarily in the interval \\([-1,1]\\).\n\nNevertheless, if \\(x_{i} \\in\\{-1,1\\}\\) for all \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, 2 n\\), then the equality \\(Z=n(n-1)\\) holds only when \\(\\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{2 n}\\right)=(0, \\pm 2,0, \\pm 2, \\ldots, 0, \\pm 2)\\) or \\(( \\pm 2,0, \\pm 2,0, \\ldots, \\pm 2,0)\\).

Several variations in setting up the auxiliary variables are possible. For instance, one may let \\(x_{2 n+i}=-x_{i}\\) and \\(y_{i}^{\\prime}=x_{i}+x_{i+1}+\\cdots+x_{i+n-1}\\) for any \\(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 2 n\\). Similarly to Solution 1 , we obtain \\(Y:=y_{1}^{\\prime 2}+y_{2}^{\\prime 2}+\\cdots+y_{2 n}^{\\prime 2}=2 n^{2}-2 Z\\). Then, it suffices to show that \\(Y \\geqslant 2 n\\). If \\(n\\) is odd, then each \\(y_{i}^{\\prime}\\) is odd, and so \\(y_{i}^{\\prime 2} \\geqslant 1\\). If \\(n\\) is even, then each \\(y_{i}^{\\prime}\\) is even. We can check that at least one of \\(y_{i}^{\\prime}, y_{i+1}^{\\prime}, y_{n+i}^{\\prime}\\), and \\(y_{n+i+1}^{\\prime}\\) is nonzero, so that \\(y_{i}^{\\prime 2}+y_{i+1}^{\\prime 2}+y_{n+i}^{\\prime 2}+y_{n+i+1}^{\\prime 2} \\geqslant 4\\); summing these up for \\(i=1,3, \\ldots, n-1\\) yields \\(Y \\geqslant 2 n\\).\n\nSolution 2. We present a different method of obtaining the bound \\(Z \\leqslant n(n-1)\\). As in the previous solution, we reduce the problem to the case \\(x_{i} \\in\\{-1,1\\}\\). For brevity, we use the notation \\([2 n]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 n\\}\\).\n\nConsider any \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{2 n} \\in\\{-1,1\\}\\).

Assume, without loss of generality, that \\(s\\) is positive. Let \\(a\\) be an arbitrary integer. Since \\(\\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{t} g=0\\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\Delta_{t} g(a)=\\Delta_{t} g(a+t)=\\cdots=\\Delta_{t} g(a+(s-1) t)\n\\]\n\nThe sum of these \\(s\\) equal numbers is \\(\\Delta_{t s} g(a)=0\\), so each of them is zero, as required.\n\nWe now return to the solution.\nStep 1. We prove that \\(f\\) is quasi-periodic.\nLet \\(Q=\\operatorname{lcm}(f(0), f(1))\\). Applying Lemma 1, we get that the function \\(g=\\Delta_{Q} f\\) is 2-periodic. In other words, the values of \\(g\\) are constant on even numbers and on odd numbers separately. Moreover, setting \\(M=Q\\) and \\(x=b=0\\) in (3), we get \\(g(0)=g(-Q)\\). Since 0 and \\(-Q\\) have different parities, the value of \\(g\\) at even numbers is the same as that at odd numbers. Thus, \\(g\\) is constant, which means that \\(Q\\) is a quasi-period of \\(f\\).\nStep 2. Denote the minimal positive quasi-period of \\(f\\) by \\(T\\). We prove that \\(T \\mid f(x)\\) for all integers \\(x\\).\n\nSince an odd number \\(Q\\) is a quasi-period of \\(f\\), the number \\(T\\) is also odd. Now suppose, to the contrary, that there exist an odd prime \\(p\\), a positive integer \\(\\alpha\\), and an integer \\(u\\) such that \\(p^{\\alpha} \\mid T\\) but \\(p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(u)\\). Setting \\(x=u\\) and \\(y=0\\) in (1), we have \\(2 f(u)=f(u+f(u))+f(u-f(u))\\), so \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) does not divide the value of \\(f\\) at one of the points \\(u+f(u)\\) or \\(u-f(u)\\). Denote this point by \\(v\\).\n\nLet \\(L=\\operatorname{lcm}(f(u), f(v))\\). Since \\(|u-v|=f(u)\\), from Lemma 1 we get \\(\\Delta_{2 f(u)} \\Delta_{L} f=0\\). Hence the function \\(\\Delta_{L} f\\) is \\(2 f(u)\\)-periodic as well as \\(T\\)-periodic, so it is \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(T, 2 f(u))\\)-periodic, or \\(\\Delta_{\\operatorname{gcd}(T, 2 f(u))} \\Delta_{L} f=0\\). Similarly, observe that the function \\(\\Delta_{\\operatorname{gcd}(T, 2 f(u))} f\\) is \\(L\\)-periodic as well as \\(T\\)-periodic, so we may conclude that \\(\\Delta_{\\operatorname{gcd}(T, L)} \\Delta_{\\operatorname{gcd}(T, 2 f(u))} f=0\\). Since \\(p^{\\alpha} \\nmid L\\), both \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(T, 2 f(u))\\) and \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(T, L)\\) divide \\(T / p\\). We thus obtain \\(\\Delta_{T / p} \\Delta_{T / p} f=0\\), which yields\n\n\\[\n\\Delta_{T / p} \\Delta_{T / p} \\Delta_{1} f=0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\Delta_{T} \\Delta_{1} f=0\\), we can apply Lemma 2 to the function \\(\\Delta_{1} f\\), obtaining \\(\\Delta_{T / p} \\Delta_{1} f=0\\). However, this means that \\(f\\) is ( \\(T / p\\) )-quasi-periodic, contradicting the minimality of \\(T\\). Our claim is proved.\n\nStep 3. We describe all functions \\(f\\).\nLet \\(d\\) be the greatest common divisor of all values of \\(f\\). Then \\(d\\) is odd. By Step 2, \\(d\\) is a quasi-period of \\(f\\), so that \\(\\Delta_{d} f\\) is constant. Since the value of \\(\\Delta_{d} f\\) is even and divisible by \\(d\\), we may denote this constant by \\(2 d k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. Next, for all \\(i=0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\), define \\(\\ell_{i}=f(i) / d\\); notice that \\(\\ell_{i}\\) is odd. Then\n\n\\[\nf(m d+i)=\\Delta_{m d} f(i)+f(i)=2 k m d+\\ell_{i} d \\quad \\text { for all } m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\quad \\text { and } i=0,1, \\ldots, d-1 .\n\\]\n\nThis shows that all functions satisfying (1) are listed in the answer.\nIt remains to check that all such functions indeed satisfy (1). This is equivalent to checking (2), which is true because for every integer \\(x\\), the value of \\(f(x)\\) is divisible by \\(d\\), so that \\(\\Delta_{f(x)} f\\) is constant.\n\nComment. After obtaining Lemmas 1 and 2, it is possible to complete the steps in a different order. Here we sketch an alternative approach.\n\nFor any function \\(g\\) and any nonzero integer \\(t\\), we say that \\(g\\) is \\(t\\)-pseudo-periodic if \\(\\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{t} g=0\\). In this case, we call \\(t\\) a pseudo-period of \\(g\\), and we say that \\(g\\) is pseudo-periodic.\n\nLet us first prove a basic property: if a function \\(g\\) is pseudo-periodic, then its minimal positive pseudo-period divides all its pseudo-periods. To establish this, it suffices to show that if \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) are pseudo-periods of \\(g\\) with \\(t \\neq s\\), then so is \\(t-s\\). Indeed, suppose that \\(\\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{t} g=\\Delta_{s} \\Delta_{s} g=0\\). Then \\(\\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{s} g=\\Delta_{t s} \\Delta_{s} g=0\\), so that \\(\\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{s} g=0\\) by Lemma 2. Taking differences, we obtain \\(\\Delta_{t} \\Delta_{t-s} g=\\Delta_{s} \\Delta_{t-s} g=0\\), and thus \\(\\Delta_{t-s} \\Delta_{t-s} g=0\\).\n\nNow let \\(f\\) satisfy the problem condition. We will show that \\(f\\) is pseudo-periodic. When this is done, we will let \\(T^{\\prime}\\) be the minimal pseudo-period of \\(f\\), and show that \\(T^{\\prime}\\) divides \\(2 f(x)\\) for every integer \\(x\\), using arguments similar to Step 2 of the solution. Then we will come back to Step 1 by showing that \\(T^{\\prime}\\) is also a quasi-period of \\(f\\).\n\nFirst, Lemma 1 yields that \\(\\Delta_{2(y-x)} \\Delta_{\\operatorname{lcm}(f(x), f(y))} f=0\\) for every distinct integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Hence \\(f\\) is pseudo-periodic with pseudo-period \\(L_{x, y}=\\operatorname{lcm}(2(y-x), f(x), f(y))\\).\n\nWe now show that \\(T^{\\prime} \\mid 2 f(x)\\) for every integer \\(x\\). Suppose, to the contrary, that there exists an integer \\(u\\), a prime \\(p\\), and a positive integer \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(p^{\\alpha} \\mid T^{\\prime}\\) and \\(p^{\\alpha} \\nmid 2 f(u)\\). Choose \\(v\\) as in Step 2 and employ Lemma 1 to obtain \\(\\Delta_{2 f(u)} \\Delta_{\\operatorname{lcm}(f(u), f(v))} f=0\\). However, this implies that \\(\\Delta_{T^{\\prime} / p} \\Delta_{T^{\\prime} / p} f=0\\), a contradiction with the minimality of \\(T^{\\prime}\\).\n\nWe now claim that \\(\\Delta_{T^{\\prime}} \\Delta_{2} f=0\\). Indeed, Lemma 1 implies that there exists an integer \\(s\\) such that \\(\\Delta_{s} \\Delta_{2} f=0\\). Hence \\(\\Delta_{T^{\\prime} s} \\Delta_{2} f=\\Delta_{T^{\\prime}} \\Delta_{T^{\\prime}} \\Delta_{2} f=0\\), which allows us to conclude that \\(\\Delta_{T^{\\prime}} \\Delta_{2} f=0\\) by Lemma 2. (The last two paragraphs are similar to Step 2 of the solution.)\n\nNow, it is not difficult to finish the solution, though more work is needed to eliminate the factors of 2 from the subscripts of \\(\\Delta_{T^{\\prime}} \\Delta_{2} f=0\\). Once this is done, we will obtain an odd quasi-period of \\(f\\) that divides \\(f(x)\\) for all integers \\(x\\). Then we can complete the solution as in Step 3."}

For every polynomial \\(F(x)\\) and every nonnegative integer \\(m\\), define \\(\\Sigma_{F}(m)=\\) \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} F(i)\\); in particular, \\(\\Sigma_{F}(0)=0\\). It is well-known that for every nonnegative integer \\(d\\) the sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} i^{d}\\) is a polynomial in \\(m\\) of degree \\(d+1\\).

This allows us to consider the values of \\(\\Sigma_{F}\\) at all real points (where the initial definition does not apply).\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) of degree \\(n\\). Then both polynomials \\(\\Sigma_{P-Q}(x)\\) and \\(\\Sigma_{P^{2}-Q^{2}}(x)\\) have roots at the points \\(0, k, 2 k, \\ldots, n k\\). This motivates the following lemma, where we use the special polynomial\n\n\\[\nT(x)=\\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-i k)\n\\]\n\nLemma. Assume that \\(F(x)\\) is a nonzero polynomial such that \\(0, k, 2 k, \\ldots, n k\\) are among the roots of the polynomial \\(\\Sigma_{F}(x)\\). Then \\(\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n\\), and there exists a polynomial \\(G(x)\\) such that \\(\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} F-n\\) and \\(F(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)\\).\nProof. If deg \\(F<n\\), then \\(\\Sigma_{F}(x)\\) has at least \\(n+1\\) roots, while its degree is less than \\(n+1\\). Therefore, \\(\\Sigma_{F}(x)=0\\) and hence \\(F(x)=0\\), which is impossible. Thus \\(\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n\\).\n\nThe lemma condition yields that \\(\\Sigma_{F}(x)=T(x) G(x)\\) for some polynomial \\(G(x)\\) such that \\(\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} \\Sigma_{F}-(n+1)=\\operatorname{deg} F-n\\).\n\nNow, let us define \\(F_{1}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)\\). Then for every positive integer \\(n\\) we have\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1))=T(n) G(n)-T(0) G(0)=T(n) G(n)=\\Sigma_{F}(n)\n\\]\n\nso the polynomial \\(\\Sigma_{F-F_{1}}(x)=\\Sigma_{F}(x)-\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(x)\\) has infinitely many roots. This means that this polynomial is zero, which in turn yields \\(F(x)=F_{1}(x)\\), as required.\n\nFirst, we apply the lemma to the nonzero polynomial \\(R_{1}(x)=P(x)-Q(x)\\). Since the degree of \\(R_{1}(x)\\) is at most \\(n\\), we conclude that it is exactly \\(n\\). Moreover, \\(R_{1}(x)=\\alpha \\cdot(T(x)-T(x-1))\\) for some nonzero constant \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nOur next aim is to prove that the polynomial \\(S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)\\) is constant. Assume the contrary. Then, notice that the polynomial \\(R_{2}(x)=P(x)^{2}-Q(x)^{2}=R_{1}(x) S(x)\\) is also nonzero and satisfies the lemma condition. Since \\(n<\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}+\\operatorname{deg} S=\\operatorname{deg} R_{2} \\leqslant 2 n\\), the lemma yields\n\n\\[\nR_{2}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)\n\\]\n\nwith some polynomial \\(G(x)\\) with \\(0<\\operatorname{deg} G \\leqslant n\\).\nSince the polynomial \\(R_{1}(x)=\\alpha(T(x)-T(x-1))\\) divides the polynomial\n\n\\[\nR_{2}(x)=T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))+G(x-1)(T(x)-T(x-1)),\n\\]\n\nwe get \\(R_{1}(x) \\mid T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))\\). On the other hand,\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(T(x), R_{1}(x)\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x)-T(x-1))=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x-1))=1,\n\\]\n\nsince both \\(T(x)\\) and \\(T(x-1)\\) are the products of linear polynomials, and their roots are distinct. Thus \\(R_{1}(x) \\mid G(x)-G(x-1)\\). However, this is impossible since \\(G(x)-G(x-1)\\) is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than \\(n=\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}\\).\n\nThus, our assumption is wrong, and \\(S(x)\\) is a constant polynomial, say \\(S(x)=\\beta\\). Notice that the polynomials \\((2 P(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha\\) and \\((2 Q(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha\\) are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus obtaining two block-similar polynomials \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) with \\(P(x)=-Q(x)=T(x)-T(x-1)\\). It remains to show that this is impossible.\n\nFor every \\(i=1,2 \\ldots, n\\), the values \\(T(i k-k+1)\\) and \\(T(i k-1)\\) have the same sign. This means that the values \\(P(i k-k+1)=T(i k-k+1)\\) and \\(P(i k)=-T(i k-1)\\) have opposite signs, so \\(P(x)\\) has a root in each of the \\(n\\) segments \\([i k-k+1, i k]\\). Since \\(\\operatorname{deg} P=n\\), it must have exactly one root in each of them.\n\nThus, the sequence \\(P(1), P(2), \\ldots, P(k)\\) should change sign exactly once. On the other hand, since \\(P(x)\\) and \\(-P(x)\\) are block-similar, this sequence must have as many positive terms as negative ones. Since \\(k=2 \\ell+1\\) is odd, this shows that the middle term of the sequence above must be zero, so \\(P(\\ell+1)=0\\), or \\(T(\\ell+1)=T(\\ell)\\). However, this is not true since\n\n\\[\n|T(\\ell+1)|=|\\ell+1| \\cdot|\\ell| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell+1-i k|<|\\ell| \\cdot|\\ell+1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell-i k|=|T(\\ell)|\n\\]\n\nwhere the strict inequality holds because \\(n \\geqslant 2\\). We come to the final contradiction.\n\nComment 1. In the solution above, we used the fact that \\(k>1\\) is odd. One can modify the arguments of the last part in order to work for every (not necessarily odd) sufficiently large value of \\(k\\); namely, when \\(k\\) is even, one may show that the sequence \\(P(1), P(2), \\ldots, P(k)\\) has different numbers of positive and negative terms.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem statement with \\(k\\) replaced by 2 is false, since the polynomials \\(P(x)=T(x)-T(x-1)\\) and \\(Q(x)=T(x-1)-T(x)\\) are block-similar in this case, due to the fact that \\(P(2 i-1)=-P(2 i)=Q(2 i)=-Q(2 i-1)=T(2 i-1)\\) for all \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\). Thus, every complete solution should use the relation \\(k>2\\).\n\nOne may easily see that the condition \\(n \\geqslant 2\\) is also substantial, since the polynomials \\(x\\) and \\(k+1-x\\) become block-similar if we set \\(n=1\\).\n\nIt is easily seen from the solution that the result still holds if we assume that the polynomials have degree at most \\(n\\).\n\nSolution 2. We provide an alternative argument for part (b).\nAssume again that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) of degree \\(n\\). Let \\(R(x)=P(x)-Q(x)\\) and \\(S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)\\). For brevity, we also denote the segment \\([(i-1) k+1, i k]\\) by \\(I_{i}\\), and the set \\(\\{(i-1) k+1,(i-1) k+2, \\ldots, i k\\}\\) of all integer points in \\(I_{i}\\) by \\(Z_{i}\\).\nStep 1. We prove that \\(R(x)\\) has exactly one root in each segment \\(I_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\) and all these roots are simple.\n\nIndeed, take any \\(i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) and choose some points \\(p^{-}, p^{+} \\in Z_{i}\\) so that\n\n\\[\nP\\left(p^{-}\\right)=\\min _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=\\max _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x)\n\\]\n\nSince the sequences of values of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) in \\(Z_{i}\\) are permutations of each other, we have \\(R\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 0\\) and \\(R\\left(p^{+}\\right)=P\\left(p^{+}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{+}\\right) \\geqslant 0\\). Since \\(R(x)\\) is continuous, there exists at least one root of \\(R(x)\\) between \\(p^{-}\\)and \\(p^{+}\\)- thus in \\(I_{i}\\).\n\nSo, \\(R(x)\\) has at least one root in each of the \\(n\\) disjoint segments \\(I_{i}\\) with \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\). Since \\(R(x)\\) is nonzero and its degree does not exceed \\(n\\), it should have exactly one root in each of these segments, and all these roots are simple, as required.\nStep 2. We prove that \\(S(x)\\) is constant.\nWe start with the following claim.\nClaim. For every \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\), the sequence of values \\(S((i-1) k+1), S((i-1) k+2), \\ldots\\), \\(S(i k)\\) cannot be strictly increasing.\nProof. Fix any \\(i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}\\). Due to the symmetry, we may assume that \\(P(i k) \\leqslant Q(i k)\\). Choose now \\(p^{-}\\)and \\(p^{+}\\)as in Step 1. If we had \\(P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)\\), then \\(P\\) would be constant on \\(Z_{i}\\), so all the elements of \\(Z_{i}\\) would be the roots of \\(R(x)\\), which is not the case. In particular, we have \\(p^{+} \\neq p^{-}\\). If \\(p^{-}>p^{+}\\), then \\(S\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)+Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)+P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=S\\left(p^{+}\\right)\\), so our claim holds.\n\nWe now show that the remaining case \\(p^{-}<p^{+}\\)is impossible. Assume first that \\(P\\left(p^{+}\\right)>\\) \\(Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)\\). Then, like in Step 1, we have \\(R\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 0, R\\left(p^{+}\\right)>0\\), and \\(R(i k) \\leqslant 0\\), so \\(R(x)\\) has a root in each of the intervals \\(\\left[p^{-}, p^{+}\\right)\\)and \\(\\left(p^{+}, i k\\right]\\). This contradicts the result of Step 1.\n\nWe are left only with the case \\(p^{-}<p^{+}\\)and \\(P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)\\)(thus \\(p^{+}\\)is the unique root of \\(R(x)\\) in \\(I_{i}\\) ). If \\(p^{+}=i k\\), then the values of \\(R(x)\\) on \\(Z_{i} \\backslash\\{i k\\}\\) are all of the same sign, which is absurd since their sum is zero. Finally, if \\(p^{-}<p^{+}<i k\\), then \\(R\\left(p^{-}\\right)\\)and \\(R(i k)\\) are both negative. This means that \\(R(x)\\) should have an even number of roots in \\(\\left[p^{-}, i k\\right]\\), counted with multiplicity. This also contradicts the result of Step 1.\n\nIn a similar way, one may prove that for every \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\), the sequence \\(S((i-1) k+1)\\), \\(S((i-1) k+2), \\ldots, S(i k)\\) cannot be strictly decreasing. This means that the polynomial \\(\\Delta S(x)=S(x)-S(x-1)\\) attains at least one nonnegative value, as well as at least one nonpositive value, on the set \\(Z_{i}\\) (and even on \\(Z_{i} \\backslash\\{(i-1) k+1\\}\\) ); so \\(\\Delta S\\) has a root in \\(I_{i}\\).\n\nThus \\(\\Delta S\\) has at least \\(n\\) roots; however, its degree is less than \\(n\\), so \\(\\Delta S\\) should be identically zero. This shows that \\(S(x)\\) is a constant, say \\(S(x) \\equiv \\beta\\).\nStep 3. Notice that the polynomials \\(P(x)-\\beta / 2\\) and \\(Q(x)-\\beta / 2\\) are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus reaching \\(P(x)=-Q(x)\\).\n\nThen \\(R(x)=2 P(x)\\), so \\(P(x)\\) has exactly one root in each of the segments \\(I_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\). On the other hand, \\(P(x)\\) and \\(-P(x)\\) should attain the same number of positive values on \\(Z_{i}\\). Since \\(k\\) is odd, this means that \\(Z_{i}\\) contains exactly one root of \\(P(x)\\); moreover, this root should be at the center of \\(Z_{i}\\), because \\(P(x)\\) has the same number of positive and negative values on \\(Z_{i}\\).\n\nThus we have found all \\(n\\) roots of \\(P(x)\\), so\n\n\\[\nP(x)=c \\prod_{i=1}^{n}(x-i k+\\ell) \\quad \\text { for some } c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\ell=(k-1) / 2\\). It remains to notice that for every \\(t \\in Z_{1} \\backslash\\{1\\}\\) we have\n\n\\[\n|P(t)|=|c| \\cdot|t-\\ell-1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|t-i k+\\ell|<|c| \\cdot \\ell \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|1-i k+\\ell|=|P(1)|,\n\\]\n\nso \\(P(1) \\neq-P(t)\\) for all \\(t \\in Z_{1}\\). This shows that \\(P(x)\\) is not block-similar to \\(-P(x)\\). The final contradiction.\n\nComment 2. One may merge Steps 1 and 2 in the following manner. As above, we set \\(R(x)=\\) \\(P(x)-Q(x)\\) and \\(S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)\\).\n\nWe aim to prove that the polynomial \\(S(x)=2 P(x)-R(x)=2 Q(x)+R(x)\\) is constant. Since the degrees of \\(R(x)\\) and \\(S(x)\\) do not exceed \\(n\\), it suffices to show that the total number of roots of \\(R(x)\\) and \\(\\Delta S(x)=S(x)-S(x-1)\\) is at least \\(2 n\\). For this purpose, we prove the following claim.\nClaim. For every \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\), either each of \\(R\\) and \\(\\Delta S\\) has a root in \\(I_{i}\\), or \\(R\\) has at least two roots in \\(I_{i}\\).\nProof. Fix any \\(i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}\\). Let \\(r \\in Z_{i}\\) be a point such that \\(|R(r)|=\\max _{x \\in Z_{i}}|R(x)|\\); we may assume that \\(R(r)>0\\). Next, let \\(p^{-}, q^{+} \\in I_{i}\\) be some points such that \\(P\\left(p^{-}\\right)=\\min _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x)\\) and \\(Q\\left(q^{+}\\right)=\\max _{x \\in Z_{i}} Q(x)\\). Notice that \\(P\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant Q(r)<P(r)\\) and \\(Q\\left(q^{+}\\right) \\geqslant P(r)>Q(r)\\), so \\(r\\) is different from \\(p^{-}\\)and \\(q^{+}\\).\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that \\(p^{-}<r\\). Then we have \\(R\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant\\) \\(0<R(r)\\), so \\(R(x)\\) has a root in \\(\\left[p^{-}, r\\right)\\). If \\(q^{+}>r\\), then, similarly, \\(R\\left(q^{+}\\right) \\leqslant 0<R(r)\\), and \\(R(x)\\) also has a root in ( \\(r, q^{+}\\)]; so \\(R(x)\\) has two roots in \\(I_{i}\\), as required.\n\nIn the remaining case we have \\(q^{+}<r\\); it suffices now to show that in this case \\(\\Delta S\\) has a root in \\(I_{i}\\). Since \\(P\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant Q(r)\\) and \\(\\left|R\\left(p^{-}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant R(r)\\), we have \\(S\\left(p^{-}\\right)=2 P\\left(p^{-}\\right)-R\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 2 Q(r)+R(r)=S(r)\\). Similarly, we get \\(S\\left(q^{+}\\right)=2 Q\\left(q^{+}\\right)+R\\left(q^{+}\\right) \\geqslant 2 P(r)-R(r)=S(r)\\). Therefore, the sequence of values of \\(S\\) on \\(Z_{i}\\) is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing, which shows that \\(\\Delta S\\) has a root in \\(I_{i}\\).\n\nComment 3. After finding the relation \\(P(x)-Q(x)=\\alpha(T(x)-T(x-1))\\) from Solution 1, one may also follow the approach presented in Solution 2. Knowledge of the difference of polynomials may simplify some steps; e.g., it is clear now that \\(P(x)-Q(x)\\) has exactly one root in each of the segments \\(I_{i}\\)."}

Without loss of generality, it is the right bulldozer of some town \\(T_{k}\\) with \\(k<n\\).\n\nSurely, with this large bulldozer \\(T_{k}\\) can sweep away all the towns to the right of it. Moreover, none of these towns can sweep \\(T_{k}\\) away; so they also cannot sweep away any town to the left of \\(T_{k}\\). Thus, if we remove the towns \\(T_{k+1}, T_{k+2}, \\ldots, T_{n}\\), none of the remaining towns would change its status of being (un)sweepable away by the others.\n\nApplying the induction hypothesis to the remaining towns, we find a unique town among \\(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{k}\\) which cannot be swept away. By the above reasons, it is also the unique such town in the initial situation. Thus the induction step is established.\n\nSolution 2. We start with the same enumeration and the same observation as in Solution 1. We also denote by \\(\\ell_{i}\\) and \\(r_{i}\\) the sizes of the left and the right bulldozers belonging to \\(T_{i}\\), respectively. One may easily see that no two towns \\(T_{i}\\) and \\(T_{j}\\) with \\(i<j\\) can sweep each other away, for this would yield \\(r_{i}>\\ell_{j}>r_{i}\\).\n\nClearly, there is no town which can sweep \\(T_{n}\\) away from the right. Then we may choose the leftmost town \\(T_{k}\\) which cannot be swept away from the right. One can observe now that no town \\(T_{i}\\) with \\(i>k\\) may sweep away some town \\(T_{j}\\) with \\(j<k\\), for otherwise \\(T_{i}\\) would be able to sweep \\(T_{k}\\) away as well.\n\nNow we prove two claims, showing together that \\(T_{k}\\) is the unique town which cannot be swept away, and thus establishing the problem statement.\n\nClaim 1. \\(T_{k}\\) also cannot be swept away from the left.\nProof. Let \\(T_{m}\\) be some town to the left of \\(T_{k}\\). By the choice of \\(T_{k}\\), town \\(T_{m}\\) can be swept away from the right by some town \\(T_{p}\\) with \\(p>m\\). As we have already observed, \\(p\\) cannot be greater than \\(k\\). On the other hand, \\(T_{m}\\) cannot sweep \\(T_{p}\\) away, so a fortiori it cannot sweep \\(T_{k}\\) away.\n\nClaim 2. Any town \\(T_{m}\\) with \\(m \\neq k\\) can be swept away by some other town.\n\nProof. If \\(m<k\\), then \\(T_{m}\\) can be swept away from the right due to the choice of \\(T_{k}\\). In the remaining case we have \\(m>k\\).\n\nLet \\(T_{p}\\) be a town among \\(T_{k}, T_{k+1}, \\ldots, T_{m-1}\\) having the largest right bulldozer. We claim that \\(T_{p}\\) can sweep \\(T_{m}\\) away. If this is not the case, then \\(r_{p}<\\ell_{q}\\) for some \\(q\\) with \\(p<q \\leqslant m\\). But this means that \\(\\ell_{q}\\) is greater than all the numbers \\(r_{i}\\) with \\(k \\leqslant i \\leqslant m-1\\), so \\(T_{q}\\) can sweep \\(T_{k}\\) away. This contradicts the choice of \\(T_{k}\\).\n\nComment 1. One may employ the same ideas within the inductive approach. Here we sketch such a solution.\n\nAssume that the problem statement holds for the collection of towns \\(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{n-1}\\), so that there is a unique town \\(T_{i}\\) among them which cannot be swept away by any other of them. Thus we need to prove that in the full collection \\(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{n}\\), exactly one of the towns \\(T_{i}\\) and \\(T_{n}\\) cannot be swept away.\n\nIf \\(T_{n}\\) cannot sweep \\(T_{i}\\) away, then it remains to prove that \\(T_{n}\\) can be swept away by some other town. This can be established as in the second paragraph of the proof of Claim 2.\n\nIf \\(T_{n}\\) can sweep \\(T_{i}\\) away, then it remains to show that \\(T_{n}\\) cannot be swept away by any other town. Since \\(T_{n}\\) can sweep \\(T_{i}\\) away, it also can sweep all the towns \\(T_{i}, T_{i+1}, \\ldots, T_{n-1}\\) away, so \\(T_{n}\\) cannot be swept away by any of those. On the other hand, none of the remaining towns \\(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{i-1}\\) can sweep \\(T_{i}\\) away, so that they cannot sweep \\(T_{n}\\) away as well.\n\nComment 2. Here we sketch yet another inductive approach. Assume that \\(n>1\\). Firstly, we find a town which can be swept away by each of its neighbors (each town has two neighbors, except for the bordering ones each of which has one); we call such town a loser. Such a town exists, because there are \\(n-1\\) pairs of neighboring towns, and in each of them there is only one which can sweep the other away; so there exists a town which is a winner in none of these pairs.\n\nNotice that a loser can be swept away, but it cannot sweep any other town away (due to its neighbors' protection). Now we remove a loser, and suggest its left bulldozer to its right neighbor (if it exists), and its right bulldozer to a left one (if it exists). Surely, a town accepts a suggestion if a suggested bulldozer is larger than the town's one of the same orientation.\n\nNotice that suggested bulldozers are useless in attack (by the definition of a loser), but may serve for defensive purposes. Moreover, each suggested bulldozer's protection works for the same pairs of remaining towns as before the removal.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, the new configuration contains exactly one town which cannot be swept away. The arguments above show that the initial one also satisfies this property.\nSolution 3. We separately prove that ( \\(i\\) ) there exists a town which cannot be swept away, and that (ii) there is at most one such town. We also make use of the two observations from the previous solutions.\nTo prove ( \\(i\\) ), assume contrariwise that every town can be swept away. Let \\(t_{1}\\) be the leftmost town; next, for every \\(k=1,2, \\ldots\\) we inductively choose \\(t_{k+1}\\) to be some town which can sweep \\(t_{k}\\) away. Now we claim that for every \\(k=1,2, \\ldots\\), the town \\(t_{k+1}\\) is to the right of \\(t_{k}\\); this leads to the contradiction, since the number of towns is finite.\n\nInduction on \\(k\\). The base case \\(k=1\\) is clear due to the choice of \\(t_{1}\\). Assume now that for all \\(j\\) with \\(1 \\leqslant j<k\\), the town \\(t_{j+1}\\) is to the right of \\(t_{j}\\). Suppose that \\(t_{k+1}\\) is situated to the left of \\(t_{k}\\); then it lies between \\(t_{j}\\) and \\(t_{j+1}\\) (possibly coinciding with \\(t_{j}\\) ) for some \\(j<k\\). Therefore, \\(t_{k+1}\\) can be swept away by \\(t_{j+1}\\), which shows that it cannot sweep \\(t_{j+1}\\) away - so \\(t_{k+1}\\) also cannot sweep \\(t_{k}\\) away. This contradiction proves the induction step.\n\nTo prove ( \\(i i\\) ), we also argue indirectly and choose two towns \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) neither of which can be swept away, with \\(A\\) being to the left of \\(B\\). Consider the largest bulldozer \\(b\\) between them (taking into consideration the right bulldozer of \\(A\\) and the left bulldozer of \\(B\\) ). Without loss of generality, \\(b\\) is a left bulldozer; then it is situated in some town to the right of \\(A\\), and this town may sweep \\(A\\) away since nothing prevents it from doing that. A contradiction.\n\nComment 3. The Problem Selection Committee decided to reformulate this problem. The original formulation was as follows.\n\nLet \\(n\\) be a positive integer. There are \\(n\\) cards in a deck, enumerated from bottom to top with numbers \\(1,2, \\ldots, n\\). For each \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, n\\), an even number \\(a_{i}\\) is printed on the lower side and an odd number \\(b_{i}\\) is printed on the upper side of the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) card. We say that the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) card opens the \\(j^{\\text {th }}\\) card, if \\(i<j\\) and \\(b_{i}<a_{k}\\) for every \\(k=i+1, i+2, \\ldots, j\\). Similarly, we say that the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) card closes the \\(j^{\\text {th }}\\) card, if \\(i>j\\) and \\(a_{i}<b_{k}\\) for every \\(k=i-1, i-2, \\ldots, j\\). Prove that the deck contains exactly one card which is neither opened nor closed by any other card."}

Again, we denote by \\(\\Omega\\) the circumcircle of the triangle \\(A B C\\).\nChoose the points \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) on the rays \\(B A\\) and \\(B C\\) respectively, so that \\(\\angle M X B=\\angle M B C\\) and \\(\\angle B Y M=\\angle A B M\\) (see Figure 4). Then the triangles \\(B M X\\) and \\(Y M B\\) are similar. Since \\(\\angle X P M=\\angle B Q M\\), the points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) correspond to each other in these triangles.

It is worth mentioning here that in case when, say, the lines \\(A B\\) and \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}\\) coincide, the circle \\(\\omega_{A}\\) is just tangent to \\(A B\\) at \\(P\\). We introduce the circles \\(\\omega_{B}, \\omega_{C}\\), and \\(\\omega_{D}\\) in a similar manner.\n\nAssume that the radii of the circles \\(\\omega_{A}\\) and \\(\\omega_{C}\\) are different. Let \\(X\\) be the center of the homothety having a positive scale factor and mapping \\(\\omega_{A}\\) to \\(\\omega_{C}\\).\n\nNow, Monge's theorem applied to the circles \\(\\omega_{A}, \\Omega\\), and \\(\\omega_{C}\\) shows that the points \\(A, C\\), and \\(X\\) are collinear. Applying the same theorem to the circles \\(\\omega_{A}, \\omega_{B}\\), and \\(\\omega_{C}\\), we see that the points \\(P, Q\\), and \\(X\\) are also collinear. Similarly, the points \\(R, S\\), and \\(X\\) are collinear, as required.\n\nIf the radii of \\(\\omega_{A}\\) and \\(\\omega_{C}\\) are equal but these circles do not coincide, then the degenerate version of the same theorem yields that the three lines \\(A C, P Q\\), and \\(R S\\) are parallel to the line of centers of \\(\\omega_{A}\\) and \\(\\omega_{C}\\).\n\nFinally, we need to say a few words about the case when \\(\\omega_{A}\\) and \\(\\omega_{C}\\) coincide (and thus they also coincide with \\(\\Omega, \\omega_{B}\\), and \\(\\omega_{D}\\) ). It may be regarded as the limit case in the following manner.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-58}\n\nFigure 2\n\nLet us fix the positions of \\(A, P, O\\), and \\(S\\) (thus we also fix the circles \\(\\omega_{A}, \\gamma_{A}, \\gamma_{B}\\), and \\(\\gamma_{D}\\) ). Now we vary the circle \\(\\gamma_{C}\\) inscribed into \\(\\angle Q O R\\); for each of its positions, one may reconstruct the lines \\(B C\\) and \\(C D\\) as the external common tangents to \\(\\gamma_{B}, \\gamma_{C}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{C}, \\gamma_{D}\\) different from \\(P R\\) and \\(Q S\\), respectively. After such variation, the circle \\(\\Omega\\) changes, so the result obtained above may be applied.\n\nSolution 2. Applying Menelaus' theorem to \\(\\triangle A B C\\) with the line \\(P Q\\) and to \\(\\triangle A C D\\) with the line \\(R S\\), we see that the line \\(A C\\) meets \\(P Q\\) and \\(R S\\) at the same point (possibly at infinity) if and only if\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A P}{P B} \\cdot \\frac{B Q}{Q C} \\cdot \\frac{C R}{R D} \\cdot \\frac{D S}{S A}=1\n\\]\n\nSo, it suffices to prove (1).\nWe start with the following result.\nLemma 1.

Applying Lemma 1 to these four quadrilaterals we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A P \\cdot P O}{O S \\cdot S A} \\cdot \\frac{B Q \\cdot Q O}{O P \\cdot P B} \\cdot \\frac{C R \\cdot R O}{O Q \\cdot Q C} \\cdot \\frac{D S \\cdot S O}{O R \\cdot R D}=\\frac{P I^{2}}{S I^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{Q J^{2}}{P J^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{R K^{2}}{Q K^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{S L^{2}}{R L^{2}},\n\\]\n\nwhich reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A P}{P B} \\cdot \\frac{B Q}{Q C} \\cdot \\frac{C R}{R D} \\cdot \\frac{D S}{S A}=\\frac{P I^{2}}{P J^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{Q J^{2}}{Q K^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{R K^{2}}{R L^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{S L^{2}}{S I^{2}} .\n\\]\n\nNext, we have \\(\\angle I P J=\\angle J O I=90^{\\circ}\\), and the line \\(O P\\) separates \\(I\\) and \\(J\\) (see Figure 4). This means that the quadrilateral IPJO is cyclic. Similarly, we get that the quadrilateral \\(J Q K O\\) is cyclic with \\(\\angle J Q K=90^{\\circ}\\). Thus, \\(\\angle Q K J=\\angle Q O J=\\angle J O P=\\angle J I P\\). Hence, the right triangles \\(I P J\\) and \\(K Q J\\) are similar. Therefore, \\(\\frac{P I}{P J}=\\frac{Q K}{Q J}\\). Likewise, we obtain \\(\\frac{R K}{R L}=\\frac{S I}{S L}\\). These two equations together with (2) yield (1).\n\nComment. Instead of using the sine law, one may prove Lemma 1 by the following approach.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-59(1)}\n\nFigure 5\n\nLet \\(N\\) be the point such that \\(\\triangle N H G \\sim \\triangle M E F\\) and such that \\(N\\) and \\(M\\) lie on different sides of the line \\(G H\\), as shown in Figure 5. Then \\(\\angle G N H+\\angle H M G=\\angle F M E+\\angle H M G=180^{\\circ}\\). So, the quadrilateral \\(G N H M\\) is cyclic. Thus, \\(\\angle M N H=\\angle M G H=\\angle F G M\\) and \\(\\angle H M N=\\angle H G N=\\) \\(\\angle E F M=\\angle M F G\\). Hence, \\(\\triangle H M N \\sim \\triangle M F G\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{H M}{H G}=\\frac{H M}{H N} \\cdot \\frac{H N}{H G}=\\frac{M F}{M G} \\cdot \\frac{E M}{E F}\\). Similarly, we obtain \\(\\frac{H M}{H E}=\\frac{M F}{M E} \\cdot \\frac{G M}{G F}\\). By multiplying these two equations, we complete the proof.\n\nSolution 3. We present another approach for showing (1) from Solution 2.\nLemma 2.

This means that all triangles in any two Thaiangulations of a convex polygon \\(\\Pi\\) have the same area.\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) be a triangulation of a convex polygon \\(\\Pi\\). If four vertices \\(A, B, C\\), and \\(D\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) form a parallelogram, and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) contains two triangles whose union is this parallelogram, then we say that \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) contains parallelogram \\(A B C D\\). Notice here that if two Thaiangulations \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) differ by two triangles, then the union of these triangles is a quadrilateral each of whose diagonals bisects its area, i.e., a parallelogram.\n\nWe start with proving two properties of triangulations.\nLemma 1. A triangulation of a convex polygon \\(\\Pi\\) cannot contain two parallelograms.\nProof. Arguing indirectly, assume that \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) are two parallelograms contained in some triangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). If they have a common triangle in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then we may assume that \\(P_{1}\\) consists of triangles \\(A B C\\) and \\(A D C\\) of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), while \\(P_{2}\\) consists of triangles \\(A D C\\) and \\(C D E\\) (see Figure 1). But then \\(B C\\|A D\\| C E\\), so the three vertices \\(B, C\\), and \\(E\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) are collinear, which is absurd.\n\nAssume now that \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) contain no common triangle. Let \\(P_{1}=A B C D\\). The sides \\(A B\\), \\(B C, C D\\), and \\(D A\\) partition \\(\\Pi\\) into several parts, and \\(P_{2}\\) is contained in one of them; we may assume that this part is cut off from \\(P_{1}\\) by \\(A D\\). Then one may label the vertices of \\(P_{2}\\) by \\(X\\), \\(Y, Z\\), and \\(T\\) so that the polygon \\(A B C D X Y Z T\\) is convex (see Figure 2; it may happen that \\(D=X\\) and/or \\(T=A\\), but still this polygon has at least six vertices). But the sum of the external angles of this polygon at \\(B, C, Y\\), and \\(Z\\) is already \\(360^{\\circ}\\), which is impossible. A final contradiction.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-62}\n\nFigure 1\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-62(2)}\n\nFigure 2\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-62(1)}\n\nFigure 3\n\nLemma 2. Every triangle in a Thaiangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) contains a side of \\(\\Pi\\).\nProof. Let \\(A B C\\) be a triangle in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Apply an affine transform such that \\(A B C\\) maps to an equilateral triangle; let \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) be the image of this triangle, and \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\) be the image of \\(\\Pi\\). Clearly, \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) maps into a Thaiangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) of \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\).\n\nAssume that none of the sides of \\(\\triangle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) is a side of \\(\\Pi^{\\prime}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) contains some other triangles with these sides, say, \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z, C^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} Y\\), and \\(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} X\\); notice that \\(A^{\\prime} Z B^{\\prime} X C^{\\prime} Y\\) is a convex hexagon (see Figure 3). The sum of its external angles at \\(X, Y\\), and \\(Z\\) is less than \\(360^{\\circ}\\). So one of these angles (say, at \\(Z\\) ) is less than \\(120^{\\circ}\\), hence \\(\\angle A^{\\prime} Z B^{\\prime}>60^{\\circ}\\). Then \\(Z\\) lies on a circular arc subtended by \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}\\) and having angular measure less than \\(240^{\\circ}\\); consequently, the altitude \\(Z H\\) of \\(\\triangle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z\\) is less than \\(\\sqrt{3} A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} / 2\\). Thus \\(\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z\\right]<\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]\\), and \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) is not a Thaiangulation. A contradiction.\n\nNow we pass to the solution. We say that a triangle in a triangulation of \\(\\Pi\\) is an ear if it contains two sides of \\(\\Pi\\). Note that each triangulation of a polygon contains some ear.\n\nArguing indirectly, we choose a convex polygon \\(\\Pi\\) with the least possible number of sides such that some two Thaiangulations \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) violate the problem statement (thus \\(\\Pi\\) has at least five sides). Consider now any ear \\(A B C\\) in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\), with \\(A C\\) being a diagonal of \\(\\Pi\\). If \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) also contains \\(\\triangle A B C\\), then one may cut \\(\\triangle A B C\\) off from \\(\\Pi\\), getting a polygon with a smaller number of sides which also violates the problem statement. This is impossible; thus \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) does not contain \\(\\triangle A B C\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) contains also another triangle with side \\(A C\\), say \\(\\triangle A C D\\). By Lemma 2, this triangle contains a side of \\(\\Pi\\), so \\(D\\) is adjacent to either \\(A\\) or \\(C\\) on the boundary of \\(\\Pi\\). We may assume that \\(D\\) is adjacent to \\(C\\).\n\nAssume that \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) does not contain the triangle \\(B C D\\). Then it contains two different triangles \\(B C X\\) and \\(C D Y\\) (possibly, with \\(X=Y\\) ); since these triangles have no common interior points, the polygon \\(A B C D Y X\\) is convex (see Figure 4). But, since \\([A B C]=[B C X]=\\) \\([A C D]=[C D Y]\\), we get \\(A X \\| B C\\) and \\(A Y \\| C D\\) which is impossible. Thus \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) contains \\(\\triangle B C D\\).\n\nTherefore, \\([A B D]=[A B C]+[A C D]-[B C D]=[A B C]\\), and \\(A B C D\\) is a parallelogram contained in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) be the Thaiangulation of \\(\\Pi\\) obtained from \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) by replacing the diagonal \\(A C\\) with \\(B D\\); then \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) is distinct from \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) (otherwise \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) would differ by two triangles). Moreover, \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) shares a common ear \\(B C D\\) with \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\). As above, cutting this ear away we obtain that \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) differ by two triangles forming a parallelogram different from \\(A B C D\\). Thus \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) contains two parallelograms, which contradicts Lemma 1.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-63}\n\nFigure 4\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-63(1)}\n\nFigure 5\n\nComment 1. Lemma 2 is equivalent to the well-known Erdős-Debrunner inequality stating that for any triangle \\(P Q R\\) and any points \\(A, B, C\\) lying on the sides \\(Q R, R P\\), and \\(P Q\\), respectively, we have\n\n\\[\n[A B C] \\geqslant \\min \\{[A B R],[B C P],[C A Q]\\} .\n\\]\n\nTo derive this inequality from Lemma 2, one may assume that (1) does not hold, and choose some points \\(X, Y\\), and \\(Z\\) inside the triangles \\(B C P, C A Q\\), and \\(A B R\\), respectively, so that \\([A B C]=\\) \\([A B Z]=[B C X]=[C A Y]\\). Then a convex hexagon \\(A Z B X C Y\\) has a Thaiangulation containing \\(\\triangle A B C\\), which contradicts Lemma 2.\n\nConversely, assume that a Thaiangulation \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) contains a triangle \\(A B C\\) none of whose sides is a side of \\(\\Pi\\), and let \\(A B Z, A Y C\\), and \\(X B C\\) be other triangles in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) containing the corresponding sides. Then \\(A Z B X C Y\\) is a convex hexagon.\n\nConsider the lines through \\(A, B\\), and \\(C\\) parallel to \\(Y Z, Z X\\), and \\(X Y\\), respectively.

We will make use of the preliminary observations from Solution 1, together with Lemma 1.\n\nArguing indirectly, we choose a convex polygon \\(\\Pi\\) with the least possible number of sides such that some two Thaiangulations \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) violate the statement (thus \\(\\Pi\\) has at least five sides). Assume that \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) share a diagonal \\(d\\) splitting \\(\\Pi\\) into two smaller polygons \\(\\Pi_{1}\\) and \\(\\Pi_{2}\\). Since the problem statement holds for any of them, the induced Thaiangulations of each of \\(\\Pi_{i}\\) differ by two triangles forming a parallelogram (the Thaiangulations induced on \\(\\Pi_{i}\\) by \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\) may not coincide, otherwise \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) would differ by at most two triangles). But both these parallelograms are contained in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\); this contradicts Lemma 1. Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) share no diagonal. Hence they also share no triangle.\n\nWe consider two cases.\nCase 1. Assume that some vertex \\(B\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) is an endpoint of some diagonal in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\), as well as an endpoint of some diagonal in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\).\n\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) be the vertices of \\(\\Pi\\) adjacent to \\(B\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) contains some triangles \\(A B X\\) and \\(B C Y\\), while \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) contains some triangles \\(A B X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(B C Y^{\\prime}\\). Here, some of the points \\(X\\), \\(X^{\\prime}, Y\\), and \\(Y^{\\prime}\\) may coincide; however, in view of our assumption together with the fact that \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) share no triangle, all four triangles \\(A B X, B C Y, A B X^{\\prime}\\), and \\(B C Y^{\\prime}\\) are distinct.\n\nSince \\([A B X]=[B C Y]=\\left[A B X^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[B C Y^{\\prime}\\right]\\), we have \\(X X^{\\prime} \\| A B\\) and \\(Y Y^{\\prime} \\| B C\\). Now, if \\(X=Y\\), then \\(X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Y^{\\prime}\\) lie on different lines passing through \\(X\\) and are distinct from that point, so that \\(X^{\\prime} \\neq Y^{\\prime}\\). In this case, we may switch the two Thaiangulations. So, hereafter we assume that \\(X \\neq Y\\).\n\nIn the convex pentagon \\(A B C Y X\\) we have either \\(\\angle B A X+\\angle A X Y>180^{\\circ}\\) or \\(\\angle X Y C+\\) \\(\\angle Y C B>180^{\\circ}\\) (or both); due to the symmetry, we may assume that the first inequality holds. Let \\(r\\) be the ray emerging from \\(X\\) and co-directed with \\(\\overrightarrow{A B}\\); our inequality shows that \\(r\\) points to the interior of the pentagon (and thus to the interior of \\(\\Pi\\) ). Therefore, the ray opposite to \\(r\\) points outside \\(\\Pi\\), so \\(X^{\\prime}\\) lies on \\(r\\); moreover, \\(X^{\\prime}\\) lies on the \"arc\" \\(C Y\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) not containing \\(X\\). So the segments \\(X X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Y B\\) intersect (see Figure 6).\n\nLet \\(O\\) be the intersection point of the rays \\(r\\) and \\(B C\\). Since the triangles \\(A B X^{\\prime}\\) and \\(B C Y^{\\prime}\\) have no common interior points, \\(Y^{\\prime}\\) must lie on the \"arc\" \\(C X^{\\prime}\\) which is situated inside the triangle \\(X B O\\). Therefore, the line \\(Y Y^{\\prime}\\) meets two sides of \\(\\triangle X B O\\), none of which may be \\(X B\\) (otherwise the diagonals \\(X B\\) and \\(Y Y^{\\prime}\\) would share a common point). Thus \\(Y Y^{\\prime}\\) intersects \\(B O\\), which contradicts \\(Y Y^{\\prime} \\| B C\\).\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-64}\n\nFigure 6\n\nCase 2. In the remaining case, each vertex of \\(\\Pi\\) is an endpoint of a diagonal in at most one of \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\). On the other hand, a triangulation cannot contain two consecutive vertices with no diagonals from each. Therefore, the vertices of \\(\\Pi\\) alternatingly emerge diagonals in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) and in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\). In particular, \\(\\Pi\\) has an even number of sides.\n\nNext, we may choose five consecutive vertices \\(A, B, C, D\\), and \\(E\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) in such a way that\n\n\\[\n\\angle A B C+\\angle B C D>180^{\\circ} \\text { and } \\angle B C D+\\angle C D E>180^{\\circ} .\n\\]\n\nIn order to do this, it suffices to choose three consecutive vertices \\(B, C\\), and \\(D\\) of \\(\\Pi\\) such that the sum of their external angles is at most \\(180^{\\circ}\\). This is possible, since \\(\\Pi\\) has at least six sides.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_8bd4da09f41316bd42acg-65}\n\nFigure 7\n\nWe may assume that \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) has no diagonals from \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) (and thus contains the triangles \\(A B C\\) and \\(C D E\\) ), while \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) has no diagonals from \\(A, C\\), and \\(E\\) (and thus contains the triangle \\(B C D)\\). Now, since \\([A B C]=[B C D]=[C D E]\\), we have \\(A D \\| B C\\) and \\(B E \\| C D\\) (see Figure 7). By (2) this yields that \\(A D>B C\\) and \\(B E>C D\\). Let \\(X=A C \\cap B D\\) and \\(Y=C E \\cap B D\\); then the inequalities above imply that \\(A X>C X\\) and \\(E Y>C Y\\).\n\nFinally, \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\) must also contain some triangle \\(B D Z\\) with \\(Z \\neq C\\); then the ray \\(C Z\\) lies in the angle \\(A C E\\). Since \\([B C D]=[B D Z]\\), the diagonal \\(B D\\) bisects \\(C Z\\). Together with the inequalities above, this yields that \\(Z\\) lies inside the triangle \\(A C E\\) (but \\(Z\\) is distinct from \\(A\\) and \\(E)\\), which is impossible. The final contradiction.\n\nComment 2. Case 2 may also be accomplished with the use of Lemma 2. Indeed, since each triangulation of an \\(n\\)-gon contains \\(n-2\\) triangles neither of which may contain three sides of \\(\\Pi\\), Lemma 2 yields that each Thaiangulation contains exactly two ears. But each vertex of \\(\\Pi\\) is a vertex of an ear either in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{1}\\) or in \\(\\mathcal{T}_{2}\\), so \\(\\Pi\\) cannot have more than four vertices."}

Then \\((w-2)(w-1)|L| T\\), so we have either \\(w^{2}-g^{2} \\geqslant 2(w-1)(w-2)\\), or \\(g=1\\) and \\(w^{2}-g^{2}=(w-1)(w-2)\\). In the former case we get \\((w-1)(w-5)+\\left(g^{2}-1\\right) \\leqslant 0\\) which is false by our assumption.

There are sixteen such triples, namely \\((2,2,2)\\), the three permutations of \\((2,2,3)\\), and the six permutations of each of \\((2,6,11)\\) and \\((3,5,7)\\).", "category": "Number Theory", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2015, "solution": "It can easily be verified that these sixteen triples are as required. Now let \\((a, b, c)\\) be any triple with the desired property. If we would have \\(a=1\\), then both \\(b-c\\) and \\(c-b\\) were powers of 2, which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows \\(a, b, c \\geqslant 2\\).\n\nCase 1. Among \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) there are at least two equal numbers.\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that \\(a=b\\). Then \\(a^{2}-c\\) and \\(a(c-1)\\) are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually \\(a\\) and \\(c-1\\) are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) with \\(a=2^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(c=2^{\\gamma}+1\\). Since \\(a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1\\) is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have \\(\\gamma \\leqslant 1\\). Moreover, each of the terms \\(2^{2 \\alpha}-2\\) and \\(2^{2 \\alpha}-3\\) can only be a power of 2 if \\(\\alpha=1\\). It follows that the triple ( \\(a, b, c\\) ) is either ( \\(2,2,2\\) ) or \\((2,2,3)\\).\n\nCase 2. The numbers \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct.\nDue to symmetry we may suppose that\n\n\\[\n2 \\leqslant a<b<c\n\\]\n\nWe are to prove that the triple \\((a, b, c)\\) is either \\((2,6,11)\\) or \\((3,5,7)\\). By our hypothesis, there exist three nonnegative integers \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nb c-a & =2^{\\alpha}, \na c-b & =2^{\\beta}, \n\\text { and } \\quad a b-c & =2^{\\gamma} .\n\n\\]\n\nEvidently we have\n\n\\[\n\\alpha>\\beta>\\gamma\n\\]\n\nDepending on how large \\(a\\) is, we divide the argument into two further cases.\nCase 2.1. \\(\\quad a=2\\).\nWe first prove that \\(\\gamma=0\\). Assume for the sake of contradiction that \\(\\gamma>0\\). Then \\(c\\) is even by (4) and, similarly, \\(b\\) is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if \\(b c=4\\). As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that \\(\\gamma=0\\), i.e., that \\(c=2 b-1\\).\n\nNow (3) yields \\(3 b-2=2^{\\beta}\\). Due to \\(b>2\\) this is only possible if \\(\\beta \\geqslant 4\\). If \\(\\beta=4\\), then we get \\(b=6\\) and \\(c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11\\), which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case \\(\\beta \\geqslant 5\\). Now (2) implies\n\n\\[\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n\\]\n\nand by \\(\\beta \\geqslant 5\\) the right-hand side is not divisible by 32. Thus \\(\\alpha \\leqslant 4\\) and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\nCase 2.2. \\(\\quad a \\geqslant 3\\).\nPick an integer \\(\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}\\) such that \\(c-\\vartheta\\) is not divisible by 4 . Now\n\n\\[\n2^{\\alpha}+\\vartheta \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=\\left(b c-a \\vartheta^{2}\\right)+\\vartheta(c a-b)=(b+a \\vartheta)(c-\\vartheta)\n\\]\n\nis divisible by \\(2^{\\beta}\\) and, consequently, \\(b+a \\vartheta\\) is divisible by \\(2^{\\beta-1}\\). On the other hand, \\(2^{\\beta}=a c-b>\\) \\((a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c\\) implies in view of (1) that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are smaller than \\(2^{\\beta-1}\\). All this is only possible if \\(\\vartheta=1\\) and \\(a+b=2^{\\beta-1}\\). Now (3) yields\n\n\\[\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\]\n\nwhence \\(4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b\\), which in turn yields \\(a=3\\).\nSo (6) simplifies to \\(c=b+2\\) and (2) tells us that \\(b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)\\) is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors \\(b-1\\) and \\(b+3\\) are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if \\(b=5\\) and thus \\(c=7\\). Thereby the solution is complete.\n\nSolution 2. As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that \\(a, b, c \\geqslant 2\\). Depending on the parities of \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) are even.\nLet \\(2^{A}, 2^{B}\\), and \\(2^{C}\\) be the largest powers of 2 dividing \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that \\(1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C\\). Now \\(2^{B}\\) is the highest power of 2 dividing \\(a c-b\\), whence \\(a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b\\). Similarly, we deduce \\(b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a\\). Adding both estimates we get \\((a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)\\), whence \\(c \\leqslant 2\\). So \\(c=2\\) and thus \\(A=B=C=1\\); moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., \\(a=2^{A}=2\\) and \\(b=2^{B}=2\\). We have thereby found the solution \\((a, b, c)=(2,2,2)\\).\n\nCase 2. The numbers \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) are odd.\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say \\(a=b\\), then \\(a c-b=a(c-1)\\) has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2. Hence \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that \\(a<b<c\\).\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) denote the nonnegative integers for which \\(b c-a=2^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(a c-b=2^{\\beta}\\) hold. Clearly, we have \\(\\alpha>\\beta\\), and thus \\(2^{\\beta}\\) divides\n\n\\[\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) is odd, it is not possible that both factors \\(b+a\\) and \\(b-a\\) are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of \\(2^{\\beta-1}\\). Hence one of the numbers \\(2(b+a)\\) and \\(2(b-a)\\) is divisible by \\(2^{\\beta}\\) and in either case we have\n\n\\[\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b)\n\\]\n\nThis in turn yields \\((a-1) b<a c-b<4 b\\) and thus \\(a=3\\) (recall that \\(a\\) is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn \\(c \\leqslant b+2\\). But due to the parity \\(b<c\\) entails that \\(b+2 \\leqslant c\\) holds as well. So we get \\(c=b+2\\) and from \\(b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)\\) being a power of 2 it follows that \\(b=5\\) and \\(c=7\\).\n\nCase 3. Among \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) both parities occur.\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that \\(c\\) is odd and that \\(a \\leqslant b\\). We are to show that \\((a, b, c)\\) is either \\((2,2,3)\\) or \\((2,6,11)\\). As at least one of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is even, the expression \\(a b-c\\) is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n\\[\na b-c=1\n\\]\n\nIf \\(a=b\\), then \\(c=a^{2}-1\\), and from \\(a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)\\) being a power of 2 it follows that both \\(a\\) and \\(a^{2}-2\\) are powers of 2 , whence \\(a=2\\). This gives rise to the solution \\((2,2,3)\\).\n\nWe may suppose \\(a<b\\) from now on. As usual, we let \\(\\alpha>\\beta\\) denote the integers satisfying\n\n\\[\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\beta=0\\) it would follow that \\(a c-b=a b-c=1\\) and hence that \\(b=c=1\\), which is absurd. So \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are positive and consequently \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even. Substituting \\(c=a b-1\\) into (9) we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2^{\\alpha} & =a b^{2}-(a+b) \n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta} & =a^{2} b-(a+b)\n\n\\]\n\nThe addition of both equation yields \\(2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)\\). Now \\(a b-2\\) is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing \\(a+b\\) is \\(2^{\\beta-1}\\). For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers \\(a b^{2}\\) and \\(a^{2} b\\) is likewise \\(2^{\\beta-1}\\). Thus there is an integer \\(\\tau \\geqslant 1\\) together with odd integers \\(A, B\\), and \\(C\\) such that \\(a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C\\), and \\(\\beta=1+3 \\tau\\).\n\nNotice that \\(A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C\\). Moreover, (11) entails \\(A^{2} B-C=2\\). Thus \\(8=\\) \\(4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)\\). Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are odd with \\(A<B\\), this is only possible if \\(A=1\\) and \\(B=3\\). Finally, one may conclude \\(C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6\\), and \\(c=11\\). We have thereby found the triple ( \\(2,6,11\\) ). This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.\n\nComment. In both solutions, there are many alternative ways to proceed in each of its cases. Here we present a different treatment of the part \" \\(a<b\\) \" of Case 3 in Solution 2, assuming that (8) and (9) have already been written down:\n\nPut \\(d=\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)\\) and define the integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) by \\(a=d p\\) and \\(b=d q\\); notice that \\(p<q\\) and \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1\\). Now (8) implies \\(c=d^{2} p q-1\\) and thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2^{\\alpha}=d\\left(d^{2} p q^{2}-p-q\\right) \n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta} & =d\\left(d^{2} p^{2} q-p-q\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nNow \\(2^{\\beta}\\) divides \\(2^{\\alpha}-2^{\\beta}=d^{3} p q(q-p)\\) and, as \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are easily seen to be coprime to \\(d^{2} p^{2} q-p-q\\), it follows that\n\n\\[\n\\left(d^{2} p^{2} q-p-q\\right) \\mid d^{2}(q-p)\n\\]\n\nIn particular, we have \\(d^{2} p^{2} q-p-q \\leqslant d^{2}(q-p)\\), i.e., \\(d^{2}\\left(p^{2} q+p-q\\right) \\leqslant p+q\\). As \\(p^{2} q+p-q>0\\), this may be weakened to \\(p^{2} q+p-q \\leqslant p+q\\). Hence \\(p^{2} q \\leqslant 2 q\\), which is only possible if \\(p=1\\).\n\nGoing back to (13), we get\n\n\\[\n\\left(d^{2} q-q-1\\right) \\mid d^{2}(q-1)\n\\]\n\nNow \\(2\\left(d^{2} q-q-1\\right) \\leqslant d^{2}(q-1)\\) would entail \\(d^{2}(q+1) \\leqslant 2(q+1)\\) and thus \\(d=1\\). But this would tell us that \\(a=d p=1\\), which is absurd. This argument proves \\(2\\left(d^{2} q-q-1\\right)>d^{2}(q-1)\\) and in the light of (14) it follows that \\(d^{2} q-q-1=d^{2}(q-1)\\), i.e., \\(q=d^{2}-1\\). Plugging this together with \\(p=1\\) into (12) we infer \\(2^{\\beta}=d^{3}\\left(d^{2}-2\\right)\\). Hence \\(d\\) and \\(d^{2}-2\\) are powers of 2 . Consequently, \\(d=2, q=3\\), \\(a=2, b=6\\), and \\(c=11\\), as desired."}

Our next goal is to prove that each row of the Table is an arithmetic progression. Assume contrariwise that the number \\(t\\) of rows which are arithmetic progressions would satisfy \\(0 \\leqslant t<k\\). By permuting the rows if necessary we may suppose that precisely the first \\(t\\) rows are arithmetic progressions, say with steps \\(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{t}\\). Our plan is to find a further row that is \"not too sparse\" in an asymptotic sense, and then to prove that such a row has to be an arithmetic progression as well.\n\nLet us write \\(T=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{t}\\right)\\) and \\(A=\\max \\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right\\}\\) if \\(t>0\\); and \\(T=1\\) and \\(A=0\\) if \\(t=0\\). For every integer \\(n \\geqslant A\\), the interval \\(\\Delta_{n}=[n+1, n+T]\\) contains exactly \\(T / T_{i}\\)\nelements of the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) row \\((1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant t)\\). Therefore, the number of elements from the last \\((k-t)\\) rows of the Table contained in \\(\\Delta_{n}\\) does not depend on \\(n \\geqslant A\\). It is not possible that none of these intervals \\(\\Delta_{n}\\) contains an element from the \\(k-t\\) last rows, because infinitely many numbers appear in these rows. It follows that for each \\(n \\geqslant A\\) the interval \\(\\Delta_{n}\\) contains at least one member from these rows.\n\nThis yields that for every positive integer \\(d\\), the interval \\([A+1, A+(d+1)(k-t) T]\\) contains at least \\((d+1)(k-t)\\) elements from the last \\(k-t\\) rows; therefore, there exists an index \\(x\\) with \\(t+1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant k\\), possibly depending on \\(d\\), such that our interval contains at least \\(d+1\\) elements from the \\(x^{\\text {th }}\\) row. In this situation we have\n\n\\[\nf^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T\n\\]\n\nFinally, since there are finitely many possibilities for \\(x\\), there exists an index \\(x \\geqslant t+1\\) such that the set\n\n\\[\nX=\\left\\{d \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\mid f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nis infinite.

Notice that we have \\(f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=a_{x}+d \\cdot T_{x}\\) for all \\(d \\in Y\\).\nNow we are prepared to prove that the numbers in the \\(x^{\\text {th }}\\) row form an arithmetic progression, thus coming to a contradiction with our assumption. Let us fix any positive integer \\(j\\). Since the set \\(Y\\) is infinite, we can choose a number \\(y \\in Y\\) such that \\(y-j>\\left|f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-\\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\\right)\\right|\\). Notice that both numbers\n\n\\[\nf^{y}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=f^{y-j}\\left(f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)\\right)-f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f^{y}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-\\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\\right)=(y-j) T_{x}\n\\]\n\nare divisible by \\(y-j\\). Thus, the difference between these numbers is also divisible by \\(y-j\\). Since the absolute value of this difference is less than \\(y-j\\), it has to vanish, so we get \\(f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=\\) \\(a_{x}+j \\cdot T_{x}\\).\n\nHence, it is indeed true that all rows of the Table are arithmetic progressions.\nStep 3. Keeping the above notation in force, we denote the step of the \\(i^{\\text {th }}\\) row of the table by \\(T_{i}\\). Now we claim that we have \\(f(n)-n=f(n+T)-(n+T)\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), where\n\n\\[\nT=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{k}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTo see this, let any \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\) be given and denote the index of the row in which it appears in the Table by \\(i\\). Then we have \\(f^{j}(n)=n+j \\cdot T_{i}\\) for all \\(j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), and thus indeed\n\n\\[\nf(n+T)-f(n)=f^{1+T / T_{i}}(n)-f(n)=\\left(n+T+T_{i}\\right)-\\left(n+T_{i}\\right)=T\n\\]\n\nThis concludes the solution.\n\nComment 1. There are some alternative ways to complete the second part once the index \\(x\\) corresponding to a \"dense row\" is found.

It may be checked that, conversely, any way to fill out the Table with finitely many arithmetic progressions so that each positive integer appears exactly once, gives rise to a function \\(f\\) satisfying the two conditions mentioned in the problem.

Find all \\(k\\) such that there exists a \\(k\\)-good function.\n\nAnswer. \\(k \\geqslant 2\\).", "category": "Number Theory", "source": "IMO Shortlist", "year": 2015, "solution": "For any function \\(f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\), let \\(G_{f}(m, n)=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m)\\). Note that a \\(k\\)-good function is also \\((k+1)\\)-good for any positive integer \\(k\\). Hence, it suffices to show that there does not exist a 1-good function and that there exists a 2-good function.\n\nWe first show that there is no 1 -good function. Suppose that there exists a function \\(f\\) such that \\(G_{f}(m, n)=1\\) for all \\(m \\neq n\\). Now, if there are two distinct even numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(f(m)\\) and \\(f(n)\\) are both even, then \\(2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)\\), a contradiction. A similar argument holds if there are two distinct odd numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(f(m)\\) and \\(f(n)\\) are both odd. Hence we can choose an even \\(m\\) and an odd \\(n\\) such that \\(f(m)\\) is odd and \\(f(n)\\) is even. This also implies that \\(2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)\\), a contradiction.\n\nWe now construct a 2-good function. Define \\(f(n)=2^{g(n)+1}-n-1\\), where \\(g\\) is defined recursively by \\(g(1)=1\\) and \\(g(n+1)=\\left(2^{g(n)+1}\\right)!\\).\n\nFor any positive integers \\(m>n\\), set\n\n\\[\nA=f(m)+n=2^{g(m)+1}-m+n-1, \\quad B=f(n)+m=2^{g(n)+1}-n+m-1\n\\]\n\nWe need to show that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) \\leqslant 2\\). First, note that \\(A+B=2^{g(m)+1}+2^{g(n)+1}-2\\) is not divisible by 4 , so that \\(4 \\nmid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)\\). Now we suppose that there is an odd prime \\(p\\) for which \\(p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)\\) and derive a contradiction.\n\nWe first claim that \\(2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant B\\). This is a rather weak bound; one way to prove it is as follows. Observe that \\(g(k+1)>g(k)\\) and hence \\(2^{g(k+1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(k)+1}+1\\) for every positive integer \\(k\\). By repeatedly applying this inequality, we obtain \\(2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(n)+1}+(m-1)-n=B\\).\n\nNow, since \\(p \\mid B\\), we have \\(p-1<B \\leqslant 2^{g(m-1)+1}\\), so that \\(p-1 \\mid\\left(2^{g(m-1)+1}\\right)!=g(m)\\). Hence \\(2^{g(m)} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)\\), which yields \\(A+B \\equiv 2^{g(n)+1}(\\bmod p)\\). However, since \\(p \\mid A+B\\), this implies that \\(p=2\\), a contradiction.\n\nSolution 2. We provide an alternative construction of a 2 -good function \\(f\\).\nLet \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be the set consisting of 4 and all odd primes. For every \\(p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), we say that a number \\(a \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, p-1\\}\\) is \\(p\\)-useful if \\(a \\not \\equiv-a(\\bmod p)\\). Note that a residue modulo \\(p\\) which is neither 0 nor 2 is \\(p\\)-useful (the latter is needed only when \\(p=4\\) ).\n\nWe will construct \\(f\\) recursively; in some steps, we will also define a \\(p\\)-useful number \\(a_{p}\\). After the \\(m^{\\text {th }}\\) step, the construction will satisfy the following conditions:\n(i) The values of \\(f(n)\\) have already been defined for all \\(n \\leqslant m\\), and \\(p\\)-useful numbers \\(a_{p}\\) have already been defined for all \\(p \\leqslant m+2\\);\n(ii) If \\(n \\leqslant m\\) and \\(p \\leqslant m+2\\), then \\(f(n)+n \\not \\equiv a_{p}(\\bmod p)\\);\n(iii) \\(\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(f\\left(n_{1}\\right)+n_{2}, f\\left(n_{2}\\right)+n_{1}\\right) \\leqslant 2\\) for all \\(n_{1}<n_{2} \\leqslant m\\).\n\nIf these conditions are satisfied, then \\(f\\) will be a 2 -good function.\nStep 1. Set \\(f(1)=1\\) and \\(a_{3}=1\\). Clearly, all the conditions are satisfied.\nStep \\(m\\), for \\(m \\geqslant 2\\). We need to determine \\(f(m)\\) and, if \\(m+2 \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), the number \\(a_{m+2}\\). Defining \\(f(m)\\). Let \\(X_{m}=\\{p \\in \\mathcal{P}: p \\mid f(n)+m\\) for some \\(n<m\\}\\). We will determine \\(f(m) \\bmod p\\) for all \\(p \\in X_{m}\\) and then choose \\(f(m)\\) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nTake any \\(p \\in X_{m}\\). If \\(p \\leqslant m+1\\), then we define \\(f(m) \\equiv-a_{p}-m(\\bmod p)\\). Otherwise, if \\(p \\geqslant m+2\\), then we define \\(f(m) \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)\\).\nDefining \\(a_{m+2}\\). Now let \\(p=m+2\\) and suppose that \\(p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\). We choose \\(a_{p}\\) to be a residue modulo \\(p\\) that is not congruent to 0,2 , or \\(f(n)+n\\) for any \\(n \\leqslant m\\). Since \\(f(1)+1=2\\), there are at most \\(m+1<p\\) residues to avoid, so we can always choose a remaining residue.\n\nWe first check that ( \\(i i\\) ) is satisfied. We only need to check it if \\(p=m+2\\) or \\(n=m\\). In the former case, we have \\(f(n)+n \\neq a_{p}(\\bmod p)\\) by construction. In the latter case, if \\(n=m\\) and \\(p \\leqslant m+1\\), then we have \\(f(m)+m \\equiv-a_{p} \\not \\equiv a_{p}(\\bmod p)\\), where we make use of the fact that \\(a_{p}\\) is \\(p\\)-useful.\n\nNow we check that (iii) holds. Suppose, to the contrary, that \\(p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(f(n)+m, f(m)+n)\\) for some \\(n<m\\). Then \\(p \\in X_{m}\\) and \\(p \\mid f(m)+n\\). If \\(p \\geqslant m+2\\), then \\(0 \\equiv f(m)+n \\equiv n(\\bmod p)\\), which is impossible since \\(n<m<p\\).\n\nOtherwise, if \\(p \\leqslant m+1\\), then\n\n\\[\n0 \\equiv(f(m)+n)+(f(n)+m) \\equiv(f(n)+n)+(f(m)+m) \\equiv(f(n)+n)-a_{p}(\\bmod p)\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(f(n)+n \\equiv a_{p}(\\bmod p)\\), a contradiction with \\((i i)\\).\nComment 1. For any \\(p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), we may also define \\(a_{p}\\) at step \\(m\\) for an arbitrary \\(m \\leqslant p-2\\). The construction will work as long as we define a finite number of \\(a_{p}\\) at each step.\n\nComment 2. When attempting to construct a 2-good function \\(f\\) recursively, the following way seems natural. Start with setting \\(f(1)=1\\). Next, for each integer \\(m>1\\), introduce the set \\(X_{m}\\) like in Solution 2 and define \\(f(m)\\) so as to satisfy\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rll}\nf(m) \\equiv f(m-p) & (\\bmod p) & \\text { for all } p \\in X_{m} \\text { with } p<m, \\quad \\text { and } \nf(m) \\equiv 0 & (\\bmod p) & \\text { for all } p \\in X_{m} \\text { with } p \\geqslant m .\n\n\\]\n\nThis construction might seem to work. Indeed, consider a fixed \\(p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), and suppose that \\(p\\) divides \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(n)+m, f(m)+n)\\) for some \\(n<m\\). Choose such \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) so that \\(\\max (m, n)\\) is minimal. Then \\(p \\in X_{m}\\). We can check that \\(p<m\\), so that the construction implies that \\(p\\) divides \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(n)+(m-p), f(m-p)+n)\\). Since \\(\\max (n, m-p)<\\max (m, n)\\), this almost leads to a contradiction-the only trouble is the possibility that \\(n=m-p\\). However, this flaw may happen to be not so easy to fix.\n\nWe will present one possible way to repair this argument in the next comment.\nComment 3. There are many recursive constructions for a 2 -good function \\(f\\). Here we sketch one general approach which may be specified in different ways. For convenience, we denote by \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\) the set of residues modulo \\(p\\); all operations on elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\) are also performed modulo \\(p\\).\n\nThe general structure is the same as in Solution 2, i.e. using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to successively determine \\(f(m)\\). But instead of designating a common \"safe\" residue \\(a_{p}\\) for future steps, we act as follows.\n\nFor every \\(p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), in some step of the process we define \\(p\\) subsets \\(B_{p}^{(1)}, B_{p}^{(2)}, \\ldots, B_{p}^{(p)} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\). The meaning of these sets is that\n\n\\[\nf(m)+m \\text { should be congruent to some element in } B_{p}^{(i)} \\text { whenever } m \\equiv i(\\bmod p) \\text { for } i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p} \\text {. }\n\\]\n\nMoreover, in every such subset we specify a safe element \\(b_{p}^{(i)} \\in B_{p}^{(i)}\\). The meaning now is that in future steps, it is safe to set \\(f(m)+m \\equiv b_{p}^{(i)}(\\bmod p)\\) whenever \\(m \\equiv i(\\bmod p)\\). In view of (1), this safety will follow from the condition that \\(p \\nmid \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(b_{p}^{(i)}+(j-i), c^{(j)}-(j-i)\\right)\\) for all \\(j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\) and all \\(c^{(j)} \\in B_{p}^{(j)}\\). In turn, this condition can be rewritten as\n\n\\[\n-b_{p}^{(i)} \\notin B_{p}^{(j)}, \\quad \\text { where } \\quad j \\equiv i-b_{p}^{(i)} \\quad(\\bmod p) .\n\\]\n\nThe construction in Solution 2 is equivalent to setting \\(b_{p}^{(i)}=-a_{p}\\) and \\(B_{p}^{(i)}=\\mathbb{Z}_{p} \\backslash\\left\\{a_{p}\\right\\}\\) for all \\(i\\). However, there are different, more technical specifications of our approach.\n\nOne may view the (incomplete) construction in Comment 2 as defining \\(B_{p}^{(i)}\\) and \\(b_{p}^{(i)}\\) at step \\(p-1\\) by setting \\(B_{p}^{(0)}=\\left\\{b_{p}^{(0)}\\right\\}=\\{0\\}\\) and \\(B_{p}^{(i)}=\\left\\{b_{p}^{(i)}\\right\\}=\\{f(i)+i \\bmod p\\}\\) for every \\(i=1,2, \\ldots, p-1\\). However, this construction violates (2) as soon as some number of the form \\(f(i)+i\\) is divisible by some \\(p\\) with \\(i+2 \\leqslant p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), since then \\(-b_{p}^{(i)}=b_{p}^{(i)} \\in B_{p}^{(i)}\\).\n\nHere is one possible way to repair this construction. For all \\(p \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), we define the sets \\(B_{p}^{(i)}\\) and the elements \\(b_{p}^{(i)}\\) at step ( \\(p-2\\) ) as follows. Set \\(B_{p}^{(1)}=\\left\\{b_{p}^{(1)}\\right\\}=\\{2\\}\\) and \\(B_{p}^{(-1)}=B_{p}^{(0)}=\\left\\{b_{p}^{(-1)}\\right\\}=\\left\\{b_{p}^{(0)}\\right\\}=\\) \\(\\{-1\\}\\). Next, for all \\(i=2, \\ldots, p-2\\), define \\(B_{p}^{(i)}=\\{i, f(i)+i \\bmod p\\}\\) and \\(b_{p}^{(i)}=i\\). One may see that these definitions agree with both (1) and (2)."}

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that \\(f\\) is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function \\(g(x)=f(x)-f(0)\\) also satisfies this condition. Replacing \\(f\\) by \\(g\\), we assume from now on that \\(f(0)=0\\); then \\(f(n)>0\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\). Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer \\(a\\) with \\(\\mho(a)=0\\) such that \\(f(n)=a n\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set \\(N=10^{100}\\). We say that a prime \\(p\\) is large if \\(p>N\\), and \\(p\\) is small otherwise; let \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer \\(k\\), we denote the greatest large divisor of \\(k\\) and the greatest small divisor of \\(k\\) by \\(L(k)\\) and \\(S(k)\\), respectively; thus, \\(k=L(k) S(k)\\).\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\nStep 1. We prove that for every large \\(k\\), we have \\(k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b\\). In other words, \\(L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)\\) for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a>b\\).\n\nWe use induction on \\(k\\). The base case \\(k=1\\) is trivial. For the induction step, assume that \\(k_{0}\\) is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers \\(k\\) with \\(k<k_{0}\\).\nClaim 1. For any integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) with \\(0<x-y<k_{0}\\), the number \\(k_{0}\\) does not divide \\(f(x)-f(y)\\).\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that \\(k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)\\). Let \\(\\ell=L(x-y)\\); then \\(\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}\\). By the induction hypothesis, \\(\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)\\), and thus \\(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)\\). Notice that \\(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)\\) is large, and \\(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell\\). But then\n\n\\[\n\\mho(f(x)-f(y)) \\geqslant \\mho\\left(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)\\right)>\\mho(\\ell)=\\mho(x-y)\n\\]\n\nwhich is impossible.\nNow we complete the induction step. By Claim 1, for every integer \\(a\\) each of the sequences\n\n\\[\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n\\]\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo \\(k_{0}\\). This yields \\(f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)\\). Thus, \\(f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)\\) whenever \\(a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)\\).\n\nFinally, if \\(a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)\\) then there exists an integer \\(b^{\\prime}\\) such that \\(b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}\\). Then \\(f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)\\). The induction step is proved.\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers \\(n\\) such that \\(\\overline{f(n)=}\\) an. In other words, \\(f\\) is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant \\(c\\) such that \\(f(t)<c t\\) for every positive integer \\(t>N\\).\nProof. Let \\(d\\) be the product of all small primes, and let \\(\\alpha\\) be a positive integer such that \\(2^{\\alpha}>f(N)\\). Then, for every \\(p \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) the numbers \\(f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)\\) are distinct modulo \\(p^{\\alpha}\\). Set \\(P=d^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(c=P+f(N)\\).\n\nChoose any integer \\(t>N\\). Due to the choice of \\(\\alpha\\), for every \\(p \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) there exists at most one nonnegative integer \\(i \\leqslant N\\) with \\(p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)\\). Since \\(|\\mathcal{S}|<N\\), we can choose a nonnegative integer \\(j \\leqslant N\\) such that \\(p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)\\) for all \\(p \\in \\mathcal{S}\\). Therefore, \\(S(f(t)-f(j))<P\\).\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that \\(L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j\\). Since \\(0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N\\), this yields\n\n\\[\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n\\]\n\nNow let \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) be the set of large primes. For every \\(t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\), Step 1 implies \\(L(f(t))=t\\), so the ratio \\(f(t) / t\\) is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}\\) and a positive integer \\(a\\) such that \\(f(t)=a t\\) for all \\(t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\), as required.\n\nSince \\(L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)\\) for all \\(t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\), we get \\(L(a)=1\\), so the number \\(a\\) is small.\nStep 3. We show that \\(f(x)=\\) ax for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).\nLet \\(R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N!)\\}\\) denote the residue class of \\(i\\) modulo \\(N!\\).\nClaim 3. Assume that for some \\(r\\), there are infinitely many \\(n \\in R_{r}\\) such that \\(f(n)=a n\\). Then \\(f(x)=a x\\) for all \\(x \\in R_{r+1}\\).\nProof. Choose any \\(x \\in R_{r+1}\\). By our assumption, we can select \\(n \\in R_{r}\\) such that \\(f(n)=\\) an and \\(|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|\\). Since \\(n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N!)\\), the number \\(|n-x|\\) is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have \\(f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)\\), so \\(n-x \\mid f(x)-a x\\). Due to the choice of \\(n\\), this yields \\(f(x)=a x\\).\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class \\(R_{i}\\). Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that \\(f(x)=a x\\) for all \\(x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N!}=R_{i}\\). This finishes the solution.\n\nComment 1. As the proposer also mentions, one may also consider the version of the problem where the condition (1) is replaced by the condition that \\(L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)\\) for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a>b\\). This allows to remove of Step 1 from the solution.\n\nComment 2. Step 2 is the main step of the solution. We sketch several different approaches allowing to perform this step using statements which are weaker than Claim 2.\n\nApproach 1. Let us again denote the product of all small primes by \\(d\\). We focus on the values \\(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)\\), \\(i \\geqslant 0\\). In view of Step 1, we have \\(L\\left(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)-f\\left(d^{k}\\right)\\right)=L\\left(d^{i}-d^{k}\\right)=d^{i-k}-1\\) for all \\(i>k \\geqslant 0\\).\n\nActing similarly to the beginning of the proof of Claim 2, one may choose a number \\(\\alpha \\geqslant 0\\) such that the residues of the numbers \\(f\\left(d^{i}\\right), i=0,1, \\ldots, N\\), are distinct modulo \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) for each \\(p \\in \\mathcal{S}\\). Then, for every \\(i>N\\), there exists an exponent \\(k=k(i) \\leqslant N\\) such that \\(S\\left(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)-f\\left(d^{k}\\right)\\right)<P=d^{\\alpha}\\).\n\nSince there are only finitely many options for \\(k(i)\\), as well as for the corresponding numbers \\(S\\left(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)-f\\left(d^{k}\\right)\\right)\\), there exists an infinite set \\(I\\) of exponents \\(i>N\\) such that \\(k(i)\\) attains the same value \\(k_{0}\\) for all \\(i \\in I\\), and such that, moreover, \\(S\\left(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)-f\\left(d^{k_{0}}\\right)\\right)\\) attains the same value \\(s_{0}\\) for all \\(i \\in I\\). Therefore, for all such \\(i\\) we have\n\n\\[\nf\\left(d^{i}\\right)=f\\left(d^{k_{0}}\\right)+L\\left(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)-f\\left(d^{k_{0}}\\right)\\right) \\cdot S\\left(f\\left(d^{i}\\right)-f\\left(d^{k_{0}}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(d^{k_{0}}\\right)+\\left(d^{i-k_{0}}-1\\right) s_{0}\n\\]\n\nwhich means that \\(f\\) is linear on the infinite set \\(\\left\\{d^{i}: i \\in I\\right\\}\\) (although with rational coefficients).\nFinally, one may implement the relation \\(f\\left(d^{i}\\right) \\equiv f(1)\\left(\\bmod d^{i}-1\\right)\\) in order to establish that in fact \\(f\\left(d^{i}\\right) / d^{i}\\) is a (small and fixed) integer for all \\(i \\in I\\).\n\nApproach 2. Alternatively, one may start with the following lemma.\nLemma. There exists a positive constant \\(c\\) such that\n\n\\[\nL\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{3 N}(f(k)-f(i))\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{3 N} L(f(k)-f(i)) \\geqslant c(f(k))^{2 N}\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(k>3 N\\).\nProof. Let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(k>3 N\\). Set \\(\\Pi=\\prod_{i=1}^{3 N}(f(k)-f(i))\\).\nNotice that for every prime \\(p \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), at most one of the numbers in the set\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}=\\{f(k)-f(i): 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 3 N\\}\n\\]\n\nis divisible by a power of \\(p\\) which is greater than \\(f(3 N)\\); we say that such elements of \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) are bad. Now, for each element \\(h \\in \\mathcal{H}\\) which is not bad we have \\(S(h) \\leqslant f(3 N)^{N}\\), while the bad elements do not exceed \\(f(k)\\).

Indeed, from Step 1 we have\n\n\\[\nk^{3 N} \\geqslant \\prod_{i=1}^{3 N} L(k-i)=\\prod_{i=1}^{3 N} L(f(k)-f(i)) \\geqslant c(f(k))^{2 N}\n\\]\n\nso \\(f(k) \\leqslant c^{-1 /(2 N)} k^{3 / 2}\\).\nTo complete Step 2 now, set \\(a=f(1)\\). Due to the estimates above, we may choose a positive integer \\(n_{0}\\) such that \\(|f(n)-a n|<\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) for all \\(n \\geqslant n_{0}\\).\n\nTake any \\(n \\geqslant n_{0}\\) with \\(n \\equiv 2(\\bmod N!)\\). Then \\(L(f(n)-f(0))=L(n)=n / 2\\) and \\(L(f(n)-f(1))=\\) \\(L(n-1)=n-1\\); these relations yield \\(f(n) \\equiv f(0)=0 \\equiv a n(\\bmod n / 2)\\) and \\(f(n) \\equiv f(1)=a \\equiv a n\\) \\((\\bmod n-1)\\), respectively. Thus, \\(\\left.\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\right\\rvert\\, f(n)-a n\\), which shows that \\(f(n)=a n\\) in view of the estimate above.\n\nComment 3. In order to perform Step 3, it suffices to establish the equality \\(f(n)=a n\\) for any infinite set of values of \\(n\\). However, if this set has some good structure, then one may find easier ways to complete this step.\n\nFor instance, after showing, as in Approach 2, that \\(f(n)=a n\\) for all \\(n \\geqslant n_{0}\\) with \\(n \\equiv 2(\\bmod N!)\\), one may proceed as follows. Pick an arbitrary integer \\(x\\) and take any large prime \\(p\\) which is greater than \\(|f(x)-a x|\\). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a positive integer \\(n>\\max \\left(x, n_{0}\\right)\\) such that \\(n \\equiv 2(\\bmod N!)\\) and \\(n \\equiv x(\\bmod p)\\). By Step 1, we have \\(f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod p)\\). Due to the choice of \\(p\\), this is possible only if \\(f(x)=a x\\)."}

Then the claim below shows that at most 3 pairs among \\(\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right)\\) are disjoint, and the same holds for \\(\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)\\). Consequently \\(n \\leq 3+3=6\\), as stated. Thus we are left with the claim and its justification.\nClaim. Let \\(\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}\\) be intervals on a straight line such that every two nonadjacent intervals intersect. Then \\(\\Delta_{k}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{k+1}\\) are disjoint for at most three values of \\(k=1, \\ldots, n\\).\nProof. Denote \\(\\Delta_{k}=\\left[a_{k}, b_{k}\\right], 1 \\leq k \\leq n\\). Let \\(\\alpha=\\max \\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)\\) be the rightmost among the left endpoints of \\(\\Delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}\\), and let \\(\\beta=\\min \\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)\\) be the leftmost among their right endpoints. Assume that \\(\\alpha=a_{2}\\) without loss of generality.\n\nIf \\(\\alpha \\leq \\beta\\) then \\(a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\beta \\leq b_{i}\\) for all \\(i\\). Every \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) contains \\(\\alpha\\), and thus no disjoint pair ( \\(\\Delta_{i}, \\Delta_{i+1}\\) ) exists.\n\nIf \\(\\beta<\\alpha\\) then \\(\\beta=b_{i}\\) for some \\(i\\) such that \\(a_{i}<b_{i}=\\beta<\\alpha=a_{2}<b_{2}\\), hence \\(\\Delta_{2}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) are disjoint. Now \\(\\Delta_{2}\\) intersects all remaining intervals except possibly \\(\\Delta_{1}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{3}\\), so \\(\\Delta_{2}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) can be disjoint only if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=3\\). Suppose by symmetry that \\(i=3\\); then \\(\\beta=b_{3}\\). Since each of the intervals \\(\\Delta_{4}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}\\) intersects \\(\\Delta_{2}\\), we have \\(a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq b_{i}\\) for \\(i=4, \\ldots, n\\). Therefore \\(\\alpha \\in \\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n}\\), in particular \\(\\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\neq \\emptyset\\). Similarly, \\(\\Delta_{5}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}, \\Delta_{1}\\) all intersect \\(\\Delta_{3}\\), so that \\(\\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1} \\neq \\emptyset\\) as \\(\\beta \\in \\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1}\\). This leaves \\(\\left(\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}\\right),\\left(\\Delta_{2}, \\Delta_{3}\\right)\\) and ( \\(\\Delta_{3}, \\Delta_{4}\\) ) as the only candidates for disjoint interval pairs, as desired.\n\nComment. The problem is a two-dimensional version of the original proposal which is included below. The extreme shortage of easy and appropriate submissions forced the Problem Selection Committee to shortlist a simplified variant. The same one-dimensional Claim is used in both versions.\n\nOriginal proposal. We consider parallelepipeds in three-dimensional space, with edges parallel to the coordinate axes and of positive length. Such a parallelepiped will be called a box. Two boxes intersect if they have a common point in their interior or on their boundary.\n\nFind the largest \\(n\\) for which there exist \\(n\\) boxes \\(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\) such that \\(B_{i}\\) and \\(B_{j}\\) intersect if and only if \\(i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1(\\bmod n)\\).\n\nThe maximum number of such boxes is 9 . Suppose that boxes \\(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\) satisfy the condition. Let the closed intervals \\(I_{k}, J_{k}\\) and \\(K_{k}\\) be the projections of box \\(B_{k}\\) onto the \\(x-, y-\\) and \\(z\\)-axis, respectively, for \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\). As before, \\(B_{i}\\) and \\(B_{j}\\) are disjoint if and only if their projections on at least one coordinate axis are disjoint.\n\nWe call again two boxes or intervals adjacent if their indices differ by 1 modulo \\(n\\), and nonadjacent otherwise.\n\nThe adjacent boxes \\(B_{i}\\) and \\(B_{i+1}\\) do not intersect for each \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\). Hence at least one of the pairs \\(\\left(I_{i}, I_{i+1}\\right),\\left(J_{i}, J_{i+1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(K_{i}, K_{i+1}\\right)\\) is a pair of disjoint intervals. So there are at least \\(n\\) pairs of disjoint intervals among \\(\\left(I_{i}, I_{i+1}\\right),\\left(J_{i}, J_{i+1}\\right),\\left(K_{i}, K_{i+1}\\right), 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\).\n\nNext, every two nonadjacent boxes intersect, hence their projections on the three axes intersect, too. Referring to the Claim in the solution of the two-dimensional version, we cocnclude that at most 3 pairs among \\(\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right)\\) are disjoint; the same holds for \\(\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(K_{1}, K_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(K_{n-1}, K_{n}\\right),\\left(K_{n}, K_{1}\\right)\\). Consequently \\(n \\leq 3+3+3=9\\), as stated.\n\nFor \\(n=9\\), the desired system of boxes exists. Consider the intervals in the following table:\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\(i\\) & \\(I_{i}\\) & \\(J_{i}\\) & \\(K_{i}\\) \n1 & \\([1,4]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([3,6]\\) \n2 & \\([5,6]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) \n3 & \\([1,2]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) \n4 & \\([3,6]\\) & \\([1,4]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) \n5 & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([5,6]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) \n6 & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([1,2]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) \n7 & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([3,6]\\) & \\([1,4]\\) \n8 & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([5,6]\\) \n9 & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([1,6]\\) & \\([1,2]\\) \nWe have \\(I_{1} \\cap I_{2}=I_{2} \\cap I_{3}=I_{3} \\cap I_{4}=\\emptyset, J_{4} \\cap J_{5}=J_{5} \\cap J_{6}=J_{6} \\cap J_{7}=\\emptyset\\), and finally \\(K_{7} \\cap K_{8}=K_{8} \\cap K_{9}=K_{9} \\cap K_{1}=\\emptyset\\).

This can be done in \\(2^{k_{\\ell}-1}\\) ways (because a \\(k_{\\ell}\\)-element set has \\(2^{k_{\\ell}-1}\\) subsets of even cardinality). Notice that \\(k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{n}=k\\).\n\nThese actions are independent, in the sense that the action involving lamp \\(\\ell\\) does not affect the action involving any other lamp. So there are \\(2^{k_{1}-1} \\cdot 2^{k_{2}-1} \\cdots 2^{k_{n}-1}=2^{k-n}\\) ways of combining these actions. In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps \\(n+1, \\ldots, 2 n\\) gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps \\(1, \\ldots, n\\) remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process \\(\\mathbf{p}\\).\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) can be modified in \\(2^{k-n}\\) ways, giving rise to \\(2^{k-n}\\) distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) can be achieved in that way. Indeed, it is enough to replace every switch of a lamp with a label \\(\\ell>n\\) that occurs in \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) by the switch of the corresponding lamp \\(\\ell-n\\); in the resulting process \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) the lamps \\(n+1, \\ldots, 2 n\\) are not involved.\n\nSwitches of each lamp with a label \\(\\ell>n\\) had occurred in \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) an even number of times. So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label \\(\\ell \\leq n\\) also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps \\(n+1, \\ldots, 2 n\\) are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process \\(\\mathbf{q}\\). These reversed replacements are nothing else than the modifications described in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nThus there is a one-to- \\(\\left(2^{k-n}\\right)\\) correspondence between the \\(M\\) restricted admissible processes and the total of \\(N\\) admissible processes. Therefore \\(N / M=2^{k-n}\\)."}

Also, \\(z \\in A\\) will be called good to \\(S_{a}\\) if \\(z\\) is \\(k\\)-good to \\(S_{a}\\) for some \\(k=1, \\ldots, n\\).\n\nWe claim that each \\(z \\in A\\) can be \\(k\\)-good to at most one set \\(S_{a}\\). Indeed, suppose on the contrary that \\(z\\) is \\(k\\)-good simultaneously to \\(S_{a}\\) and \\(S_{b}\\), with \\(a<b\\).

Then \\(2\\left(u_{m}-u_{m-1}\\right) \\leq u_{m}-u_{1}<2^{k+1}\\) yields \\(u_{m}-u_{m-1}<2^{k}\\). However the elements \\(z=u_{m}, x=u_{1}\\), \\(y=u_{m-1}\\) of \\(S_{a}\\) then satisfy \\(z-y<2^{k}\\) and \\(z-x \\geq 2^{k}\\), so that \\(z=u_{m}\\) is \\(k\\)-good to \\(S_{a}\\).\n\nThus each term of the sequence \\(u_{2}-u_{1}, u_{3}-u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{p}-u_{1}\\) is more than twice the previous one.

Observe that if the sets \\(S_{i}(1 \\leq i \\leq k)\\) satisfy the condition then so do their arbitrary subsets \\(T_{i}(1 \\leq i \\leq k)\\). The condition also holds for the sets \\(t+S_{i}=\\left\\{t+x \\mid x \\in S_{i}\\right\\}\\) where \\(t\\) is arbitrary.\n\nNote also that a set may occur more than once among \\(S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{k}\\) only if its cardinality is less than 3 , in which case its contribution to the sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-n\\right)\\) is nonpositive (as \\(n \\geq 2\\) ).\n\nThe proof is by induction on \\(n\\). In the base case \\(n=2\\) we have subsets \\(S_{i}\\) of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\). Only the ones of cardinality 3 and 4 need to be considered by the remark above; each one of\nthem occurs at most once among \\(S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{k}\\). If \\(S_{i}=\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) for some \\(i\\) then no \\(S_{j}\\) is a 3-element subset in view of the condition, hence \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2\\right) \\leq 2\\). By the condition again, it is impossible that \\(S_{i}=\\{1,3,4\\}\\) and \\(S_{j}=\\{2,3,4\\}\\) for some \\(i, j\\). So if \\(\\left|S_{i}\\right| \\leq 3\\) for all \\(i\\) then at most 3 summands \\(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2\\) are positive, corresponding to 3 -element subsets. This implies \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2\\right) \\leq 3\\), therefore the conclusion is true for \\(n=2\\).\n\nSuppose that the claim holds for some \\(n \\geq 2\\), and let the sets \\(S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{k} \\subseteq\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2^{n+1}\\right\\}\\) satisfy the given property. Denote \\(U_{i}=S_{i} \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2^{n}\\right\\}, V_{i}=S_{i} \\cap\\left\\{2^{n}+1, \\ldots, 2^{n+1}\\right\\}\\).

Consequently, this gives \\(\\sum_{j \\in J}\\left(\\left|S_{j}\\right|-n\\right) \\leq(2 n-1) 2^{n-2}\\), so that\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j \\in J}\\left(\\left|S_{j}\\right|-(n+1)\\right) \\leq \\sum_{j \\in J}\\left(\\left|S_{j}\\right|-n\\right) \\leq(2 n-1) 2^{n-2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(i \\in I\\), denote by \\(v_{i}\\) the least element of \\(V_{i}\\). Observe that if \\(V_{a}\\) and \\(V_{b}\\) intersect, with \\(a<b\\), \\(a, b \\in I\\), then \\(v_{a}\\) is their unique common element. Indeed, let \\(z \\in V_{a} \\cap V_{b} \\subseteq S_{a} \\cap S_{b}\\) and let \\(m\\) be the least element of \\(S_{b}\\). Since \\(b \\in I\\), we have \\(m \\leq 2^{n}\\). By the condition, there is no element of \\(S_{a}\\) strictly between \\(m \\leq 2^{n}\\) and \\(z>2^{n}\\), which implies \\(z=v_{a}\\).\n\nIt follows that if the element \\(v_{i}\\) is removed from each \\(V_{i}\\), a family of pairwise disjoint sets \\(W_{i}=V_{i} \\backslash\\left\\{v_{i}\\right\\}\\) is obtained, \\(i \\in I\\) (we assume \\(W_{i}=\\emptyset\\) if \\(V_{i}=\\emptyset\\) ).

Here is another way to reach the conclusion that the lines \\(A D, B C\\) and \\(P Q\\) are either concurrent or parallel.

Analogously, the circumcircle of triangle \\(E B C\\) is tangent to \\(P Q\\) at \\(E\\).\n\nSuppose that the line \\(A D\\) intersects \\(P Q\\) at \\(X\\). Since \\(X E\\) is tangent to the circle \\((E A D)\\), \\(X E^{2}=X A \\cdot X D\\). Also, \\(X A \\cdot X D=X P \\cdot X Q\\) because \\(P, Q, D, A\\) lie on a circle. Therefore \\(X E^{2}=X P \\cdot X Q\\).\n\nIt is not hard to see that this equation determines the position of the point \\(X\\) on the line \\(P Q\\) uniquely. Thus, if \\(B C\\) also cuts \\(P Q\\), say at \\(Y\\), then the analogous equation for \\(Y\\) yields \\(X=Y\\), meaning that the three lines indeed concur. In this case, as well as in the case where \\(A D\\|P Q\\| B C\\), the concluding argument is the same as in the first solution.\n\nIt remains to eliminate the possibility that e.g. \\(A D\\) meets \\(P Q\\) at \\(X\\) while \\(B C \\| P Q\\). Indeed, \\(Q P B C\\) would then be an isosceles trapezoid and the angle equality \\(\\angle P B E=\\angle Q C E\\) would force that \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(P Q\\). So the length of \\(X E\\), which is the geometric mean of the lengths of \\(X P\\) and \\(X Q\\), should also be their arithmetic mean-impossible, as \\(X P \\neq X Q\\). The proof is now complete.\n\nComment. After reaching the conclusion that the circles \\((E D A)\\) and \\((E B C)\\) are tangent to \\(P Q\\) one may continue as follows. Denote the circles (PQDA), \\((E D A),(E B C),(Q P B C)\\) by \\(\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\omega_{3}, \\omega_{4}\\) respectively. Let \\(\\ell_{i j}\\) be the radical axis of the pair ( \\(\\omega_{i}, \\omega_{j}\\) ) for \\(i<j\\). As is well-known, the lines \\(\\ell_{12}, \\ell_{13}, \\ell_{23}\\) concur, possibly at infinity (let this be the meaning of the word concur in this comment). So do the lines \\(\\ell_{12}, \\ell_{14}, \\ell_{24}\\). Note however that \\(\\ell_{23}\\) and \\(\\ell_{14}\\) both coincide with the line \\(P Q\\). Hence the pair \\(\\ell_{12}, P Q\\) is in both triples; thus the four lines \\(\\ell_{12}, \\ell_{13}, \\ell_{24}\\) and \\(P Q\\) are concurrent.\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\ell_{13}, \\ell_{14}, \\ell_{34}\\) concur, \\(\\ell_{23}, \\ell_{24}, \\ell_{34}\\) concur, and since \\(\\ell_{14}=\\ell_{23}=P Q\\), the four lines \\(\\ell_{13}, \\ell_{24}, \\ell_{34}\\) and \\(P Q\\) are concurrent. The lines \\(\\ell_{13}\\) and \\(\\ell_{24}\\) are present in both quadruples, therefore all the lines \\(\\ell_{i j}\\) are concurrent. Hence the result."}

So assume that \\(A B C D\\) is not a rhombus, and let \\(B R<D R\\) without loss of generality.\n\nDenote by \\(U_{A}\\) and \\(U_{C}\\) the circumcentres of the triangles \\(A B D\\) and \\(C D B\\), respectively. Let \\(A V_{A}\\) and \\(C V_{C}\\) be the diameters through \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) of the two circumcircles. Since \\(A R\\) is an altitude in triangle \\(A D B\\), lines \\(A C\\) and \\(A V_{A}\\) are isogonal conjugates, i. e. \\(\\angle D A V_{A}=\\angle B A C\\). Now \\(B R<D R\\) implies that ray \\(A U_{A}\\) lies in \\(\\angle D A C\\). Similarly, ray \\(C U_{C}\\) lies in \\(\\angle D C A\\). Both diameters \\(A V_{A}\\) and \\(C V_{C}\\) intersect \\(B D\\) as the angles at \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) of both triangles are acute. Also \\(U_{A} U_{C}\\) is parallel to \\(A C\\) as it is the perpendicular bisector of \\(B D\\). Hence \\(V_{A} V_{C}\\) is parallel to \\(A C\\), too. We infer that \\(A V_{A}\\) and \\(C V_{C}\\) intersect at a point \\(P\\) inside triangle \\(A C D\\), hence inside \\(A B C D\\).\n\nConstruct points \\(K, L, M, N, O_{A}\\) and \\(O_{C}\\) in the same way as in the introduction. It follows from the previous paragraph that \\(K, L, M, N\\) are interior to the respective sides. Now \\(O_{A} O_{C}\\) is a midline in triangle \\(A C P\\) again. Therefore lines \\(A C, O_{A} O_{C}\\) and \\(U_{A} U_{C}\\) are parallel.\n\nThe cyclic quadrilateral \\(A K P N\\) yields \\(\\angle N K P=\\angle N A P\\). Since \\(\\angle N A P=\\angle D A U_{A}=\\) \\(\\angle B A C\\), as specified above, we obtain \\(\\angle N K P=\\angle B A C\\). Because \\(P K\\) is perpendicular to \\(A B\\), it follows that \\(N K\\) is perpendicular to \\(A C\\), hence parallel to \\(B D\\). Likewise, \\(L M\\) is parallel to \\(B D\\).\n\nConsider the two homotheties with centres \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) which transform triangles \\(A B D\\) and \\(C D B\\) into triangles \\(A K N\\) and \\(C M L\\), respectively. The images of points \\(U_{A}\\) and \\(U_{C}\\) are \\(O_{A}\\) and \\(O_{C}\\), respectively. Since \\(U_{A} U_{C}\\) and \\(O_{A} O_{C}\\) are parallel to \\(A C\\), the two ratios of homothety are the same, equal to \\(\\lambda=A N / A D=A K / A B=A O_{A} / A U_{A}=C O_{C} / C U_{C}=C M / C D=C L / C B\\). It is now straightforward that \\(D N / D A=D M / D C=B K / B A=B L / B C=1-\\lambda\\). Hence \\(K L\\) and \\(M N\\) are parallel to \\(A C\\), implying that \\(K L M N\\) is a rectangle and completing the proof.\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2025_05_30_2a06c33868bd686c236cg-39}\n\nSolution 2. For a point \\(P\\) distinct from \\(A, B, C, D\\), let circles \\((A P D)\\) and \\((B P C)\\) intersect again at \\(Q(Q=P\\) if the circles are tangent \\()\\). Next, let circles \\((A Q B)\\) and \\((C Q D)\\) intersect again at \\(R\\). We show that if \\(P\\) lies in \\(A B C D\\) and satisfies (1) then \\(A C\\) and \\(B D\\) intersect at \\(R\\) and are perpendicular; the converse is also true. It is convenient to use directed angles. Let \\(\\measuredangle(U V, X Y)\\) denote the angle of counterclockwise rotation that makes line \\(U V\\) parallel to line \\(X Y\\). Recall that four noncollinear points \\(U, V, X, Y\\) are concyclic if and only if \\(\\measuredangle(U X, V X)=\\measuredangle(U Y, V Y)\\).\n\nThe definitions of points \\(P, Q\\) and \\(R\\) imply\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\measuredangle(A R, B R) & =\\measuredangle(A Q, B Q)=\\measuredangle(A Q, P Q)+\\measuredangle(P Q, B Q)=\\measuredangle(A D, P D)+\\measuredangle(P C, B C), \n\\measuredangle(C R, D R) & =\\measuredangle(C Q, D Q)=\\measuredangle(C Q, P Q)+\\measuredangle(P Q, D Q)=\\measuredangle(C B, P B)+\\measuredangle(P A, D A), \n\\measuredangle(B R, C R) & =\\measuredangle(B R, R Q)+\\measuredangle(R Q, C R)=\\measuredangle(B A, A Q)+\\measuredangle(D Q, C D) \n& =\\measuredangle(B A, A P)+\\measuredangle(A P, A Q)+\\measuredangle(D Q, D P)+\\measuredangle(D P, C D) \n& =\\measuredangle(B A, A P)+\\measuredangle(D P, C D) .\n\n\\]\n\nObserve that the whole construction is reversible. One may start with point \\(R\\), define \\(Q\\) as the second intersection of circles \\((A R B)\\) and \\((C R D)\\), and then define \\(P\\) as the second intersection of circles \\((A Q D)\\) and \\((B Q C)\\).

Then \\(\\measuredangle(A R, B R)=\\angle P D A+\\angle P C B=90^{\\circ}\\) and similarly \\(\\measuredangle(B R, C R)=\\measuredangle(C R, D R)=90^{\\circ}\\). It follows that \\(R\\) is the common point of lines \\(A C\\) and \\(B D\\), and that these lines are perpendicular.\n(ii) Suppose that \\(A C\\) and \\(B D\\) are perpendicular and intersect at \\(R\\). We show that the point \\(P\\) defined by the reverse construction (starting with \\(R\\) and ending with \\(P\\) ) lies in \\(A B C D\\). This is enough to finish the solution, because then the angle equalities above will imply (1).\n\nOne can assume that \\(Q\\), the second common point of circles \\((A B R)\\) and \\((C D R)\\), lies in \\(\\angle A R D\\). Then in fact \\(Q\\) lies in triangle \\(A D R\\) as angles \\(A Q R\\) and \\(D Q R\\) are obtuse. Hence \\(\\angle A Q D\\) is obtuse, too, so that \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are outside circle ( \\(A D Q\\) ) ( \\(\\angle A B D\\) and \\(\\angle A C D\\) are acute).\n\nNow \\(\\angle C A B+\\angle C D B=\\angle B Q R+\\angle C Q R=\\angle C Q B\\) implies \\(\\angle C A B<\\angle C Q B\\) and \\(\\angle C D B<\\) \\(\\angle C Q B\\).

The incircle of triangle \\(A B C\\) is tangent to its side \\(A C\\) at \\(P\\). Let \\(P P^{\\prime}\\) be the diameter of the incircle through \\(P\\), and let line \\(B P^{\\prime}\\) intersect \\(A C\\) at \\(Q\\). Then \\(Q\\) is the point of tangency of side \\(A C\\) and excircle \\(A C\\).\nProof. Let the tangent at \\(P^{\\prime}\\) to the incircle \\(\\omega_{1}\\) meet \\(B A\\) and \\(B C\\) at \\(A^{\\prime}\\) and \\(C^{\\prime}\\). Now \\(\\omega_{1}\\) is the excircle \\(A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) of triangle \\(A^{\\prime} B C^{\\prime}\\), and it touches side \\(A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\) at \\(P^{\\prime}\\). Since \\(A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} \\| A C\\), the homothety with centre \\(B\\) and ratio \\(B Q / B P^{\\prime}\\) takes \\(\\omega_{1}\\) to the excircle \\(A C\\) of triangle \\(A B C\\). Because this homothety takes \\(P^{\\prime}\\) to \\(Q\\), the lemma follows.\n\nRecall also that if the incircle of a triangle touches its side \\(A C\\) at \\(P\\), then the tangency point \\(Q\\) of the same side and excircle \\(A C\\) is the unique point on line segment \\(A C\\) such that \\(A P=C Q\\).\n\nWe pass on to the main proof. Let \\(\\omega_{1}\\) and \\(\\omega_{2}\\) touch \\(A C\\) at \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), respectively; then \\(A P=(A C+A B-B C) / 2, C Q=(C A+C D-A D) / 2\\). Since \\(A B-B C=C D-A D\\) by Lemma 1, we obtain \\(A P=C Q\\). It follows that in triangle \\(A B C\\) side \\(A C\\) and excircle \\(A C\\) are tangent at \\(Q\\). Likewise, in triangle \\(A D C\\) side \\(A C\\) and excircle \\(A C\\) are tangent at \\(P\\). Note that \\(P \\neq Q\\) as \\(A B \\neq B C\\).\n\nLet \\(P P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Q Q^{\\prime}\\) be the diameters perpendicular to \\(A C\\) of \\(\\omega_{1}\\) and \\(\\omega_{2}\\), respectively. Then Lemma 2 shows that points \\(B, P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Q\\) are collinear, and so are points \\(D, Q^{\\prime}\\) and \\(P\\).\n\nConsider the diameter of \\(\\omega\\) perpendicular to \\(A C\\) and denote by \\(T\\) its endpoint that is closer to \\(A C\\). The homothety with centre \\(B\\) and ratio \\(B T / B P^{\\prime}\\) takes \\(\\omega_{1}\\) to \\(\\omega\\). Hence \\(B, P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(T\\) are collinear. Similarly, \\(D, Q^{\\prime}\\) and \\(T\\) are collinear since the homothety with centre \\(D\\) and ratio \\(-D T / D Q^{\\prime}\\) takes \\(\\omega_{2}\\) to \\(\\omega\\).\n\nWe infer that points \\(T, P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Q\\) are collinear, as well as \\(T, Q^{\\prime}\\) and \\(P\\). Since \\(P P^{\\prime} \\| Q Q^{\\prime}\\), line segments \\(P P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Q Q^{\\prime}\\) are then homothetic with centre \\(T\\). The same holds true for circles \\(\\omega_{1}\\) and \\(\\omega_{2}\\) because they have \\(P P^{\\prime}\\) and \\(Q Q^{\\prime}\\) as diameters. Moreover, it is immediate that \\(T\\) lies on the same side of line \\(P P^{\\prime}\\) as \\(Q\\) and \\(Q^{\\prime}\\), hence the ratio of homothety is positive.

So \\(n\\) must be even.\n\nLet \\(d\\) be the greatest common divisor of the three differences \\(a-b, b-c, c-a\\), so that \\(a-b=d u, b-c=d v, c-a=d w ; \\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1, u+v+w=0\\).\n\nFrom \\(a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)\\) we see that \\((a-b) \\mid p(b-c)\\), i.e., \\(u \\mid p v\\); and cyclically \\(v|p w, w| p u\\). As \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1\\) and \\(u+v+w=0\\), at most one of \\(u, v, w\\) can be divisible by \\(p\\). Supposing that the prime \\(p\\) does not divide any one of them, we get \\(u|v, v| w, w \\mid u\\), whence \\(|u|=|v|=|w|=1\\); but this quarrels with \\(u+v+w=0\\).\n\nThus \\(p\\) must divide exactly one of these numbers. Let e.g. \\(p \\mid u\\) and write \\(u=p u_{1}\\). Now we obtain, similarly as before, \\(u_{1}|v, v| w, w \\mid u_{1}\\) so that \\(\\left|u_{1}\\right|=|v|=|w|=1\\).

This sum of \\(n=2 k\\) summands is odd only if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have different parities. The same conclusion holding for \\(b, c\\) and for \\(c, a\\), we get that \\(a, b, c, a\\) alternate in their parities, which is clearly impossible.\n\nThus \\(p=2\\). The original system shows that \\(a, b, c\\) must be of the same parity. So we may divide (1) by \\(p^{3}\\), i.e. \\(2^{3}\\), to obtain the following product of six integer factors:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^{k}+b^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a^{k}-b^{k}}{a-b} \\cdot \\frac{b^{k}+c^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{b^{k}-c^{k}}{b-c} \\cdot \\frac{c^{k}+a^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{c^{k}-a^{k}}{c-a}=-1 .\n\\]\n\nEach one of the factors must be equal to \\(\\pm 1\\). In particular, \\(a^{k}+b^{k}= \\pm 2\\). If \\(k\\) is even, this becomes \\(a^{k}+b^{k}=2\\) and yields \\(|a|=|b|=1\\), whence \\(a^{k}-b^{k}=0\\), contradicting (2).\n\nLet now \\(k\\) be odd. Then the sum \\(a^{k}+b^{k}\\), with value \\(\\pm 2\\), has \\(a+b\\) as a factor. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are of the same parity, this means that \\(a+b= \\pm 2\\); and cyclically, \\(b+c= \\pm 2, c+a= \\pm 2\\). In some two of these equations the signs must coincide, hence some two of \\(a, b, c\\) are equal. This is the desired contradiction.\n\nComment. Having arrived at the equation (1) one is tempted to write down all possible decompositions of \\(-p^{3}\\) (cube of a prime) into a product of three integers. This leads to cumbersome examination of many cases, some of which are unpleasant to handle.

For each \\(i \\geq 1\\) we also have \\(a_{i+1}-a_{i} \\geq \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\\right)>a_{i-1}\\), and consequently \\(a_{i+1} \\geq a_{i}+a_{i-1}+1\\). Hence \\(a_{2} \\geq 4\\) and \\(a_{3} \\geq 7\\). The equality \\(a_{3}=7\\) would force equalities in the previous estimates, leading to \\(\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{2}, a_{3}\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(4,7)>a_{1}=2\\), which is false. Thus \\(a_{3} \\geq 8\\); the result is valid for \\(n=0,1,2,3\\). These are the base cases for a proof by induction.\n\nTake an \\(n \\geq 3\\) and assume that \\(a_{i} \\geq 2^{i}\\) for \\(i=0,1, \\ldots, n\\). We must show that \\(a_{n+1} \\geq 2^{n+1}\\).

Also \\(a_{n-1}<d=\\frac{1}{2} m d^{\\prime}\\), \\(a_{n+1}=\\frac{3}{2} m d^{\\prime}\\).

The last relation implies that \\(a_{n-1}\\) is either \\(d^{\\prime}\\) or \\(2 d^{\\prime}\\). Anyway, \\(a_{n-1} \\mid 2 d^{\\prime}\\).\n\nThe same pattern repeats once more. We denote \\(\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}\\right)=d^{\\prime \\prime}\\); then \\(d^{\\prime \\prime}>a_{n-3}\\). Because \\(d^{\\prime \\prime}\\) is a divisor of \\(a_{n-1}\\), hence also of \\(2 d^{\\prime}\\), we may write \\(2 d^{\\prime}=m^{\\prime} d^{\\prime \\prime}\\) ( \\(m^{\\prime}\\) an integer).

But now there are no cases left. Induction is complete; the inequality \\(a_{n} \\geq 2^{n}\\) holds for all \\(n\\)."}

The induction hypothesis is that all the numbers \\(a_{k}\\left(0 \\leq k<2^{n-2}\\right)\\) are distinct \\(\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)\\); the claim is that all the numbers \\(b_{m}\\left(0 \\leq m<2^{n-1}\\right)\\) are distinct ( \\(\\bmod 2^{n}\\) ).\n\nThe congruence relations (1) are restated as\n\n\\[\nb_{2 k} \\equiv(-1)^{k} a_{k} \\equiv-b_{2 k+1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\nShifting the exponent in the first relation of (1) from \\(n\\) to \\(n-1\\) we also have the congruence \\(a_{2 i+1} \\equiv-a_{2 i}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)\\). We hence conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\text { If, for some } j, k<2^{n-2}, \\quad a_{k} \\equiv-a_{j}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right), \\text { then }\\{j, k\\}=\\{2 i, 2 i+1\\} \\text { for some } i \\text {. }\n\\]\n\nThis is so because in the sequence ( \\(a_{k}: k<2^{n-2}\\) ) each term \\(a_{j}\\) is complemented to \\(0\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)\\) by only one other term \\(a_{k}\\), according to the induction hypothesis.\n\nFrom (2) we see that \\(b_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i}\\) and \\(b_{4 i+3} \\equiv a_{2 i+1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\). Let\n\n\\[\nM=\\left\\{m: 0 \\leq m<2^{n-1}, m \\equiv 0 \\text { or } 3(\\bmod 4)\\right\\}, \\quad L=\\left\\{l: 0 \\leq l<2^{n-1}, l \\equiv 1 \\text { or } 2(\\bmod 4)\\right\\}\n\\]\n\nThe last two congruences take on the unified form\n\n\\[\nb_{m} \\equiv a_{\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \\quad \\text { for all } \\quad m \\in M\n\\]\n\nThus all the numbers \\(b_{m}\\) for \\(m \\in M\\) are distinct ( \\(\\bmod 2^{n}\\) ) because so are the numbers \\(a_{k}\\) (they are distinct \\(\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)\\), hence also \\(\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) ).\n\nEvery \\(l \\in L\\) is paired with a unique \\(m \\in M\\) into a pair of the form \\(\\{2 k, 2 k+1\\}\\). So (2) implies that also all the \\(b_{l}\\) for \\(l \\in L\\) are distinct ( \\(\\bmod 2^{n}\\) ). It remains to eliminate the possibility that \\(b_{m} \\equiv b_{l}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) for some \\(m \\in M, l \\in L\\).\n\nSuppose that such a situation occurs. Let \\(m^{\\prime} \\in M\\) be such that \\(\\left\\{m^{\\prime}, l\\right\\}\\) is a pair of the form \\(\\{2 k, 2 k+1\\}\\), so that (see (2)) \\(\\quad b_{m^{\\prime}} \\equiv-b_{l}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\). Hence \\(b_{m^{\\prime}} \\equiv-b_{m}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\). Since both \\(m^{\\prime}\\) and \\(m\\) are in \\(M\\), we have by (4) \\(b_{m^{\\prime}} \\equiv a_{j}, b_{m} \\equiv a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) for \\(j=\\left\\lfloor m^{\\prime} / 2\\right\\rfloor, k=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor\\).\n\nThen \\(a_{j} \\equiv-a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\). Thus, according to (3), \\(j=2 i, k=2 i+1\\) for some \\(i\\) (or vice versa). The equality \\(a_{2 i+1} \\equiv-a_{2 i}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\) now means that \\(\\binom{2^{n-1}-1}{2 i}+\\binom{2^{n-1}-1}{2 i+1} \\equiv 0\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\\). However, the sum on the left is equal to \\(\\binom{2^{n-1}}{2 i+1}\\). A number of this form cannot be divisible by \\(2^{n}\\). This is a contradiction which concludes the induction step and proves the result.\n\nSolution 2. We again proceed by induction, writing for brevity \\(N=2^{n-1}\\) and keeping notation \\(a_{k}=\\binom{N-1}{k}, b_{m}=\\binom{2 N-1}{m}\\). Assume that the result holds for the sequence \\(\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{N / 2-1}\\right)\\). In view of the symmetry \\(a_{N-1-k}=a_{k}\\) this sequence is a permutation of ( \\(a_{0}, a_{2}, a_{4}, \\ldots, a_{N-2}\\) ). So the induction hypothesis says that this latter sequence, taken \\((\\bmod N)\\), is a permutation of \\((1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1)\\). Similarly, the induction claim is that \\(\\left(b_{0}, b_{2}, b_{4}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-2}\\right)\\), taken \\((\\bmod 2 N)\\), is a permutation of \\((1,3,5, \\ldots, 2 N-1)\\).\n\nIn place of the congruence relations (2) we now use the following ones,\n\n\\[\nb_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i} \\quad(\\bmod N) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad b_{4 i+2} \\equiv b_{4 i}+N \\quad(\\bmod 2 N)\n\\]\n\nGiven this, the conclusion is immediate: the first formula of (5) together with the induction hypothesis tells us that \\(\\left(b_{0}, b_{4}, b_{8}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-4}\\right)(\\bmod N)\\) is a permutation of \\((1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1)\\). Then the second formula of (5) shows that ( \\(b_{2}, b_{6}, b_{10}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-2}\\) ) ( \\(\\bmod N\\) ) is exactly the same permutation; moreover, this formula distinguishes \\((\\bmod 2 N)\\) each \\(b_{4 i}\\) from \\(b_{4 i+2}\\).\n\nConsequently, these two sequences combined represent (mod \\(2 N\\) ) a permutation of the sequence \\((1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1, N+1, N+3, N+5, \\ldots, N+N-1)\\), and this is precisely the induction claim.\n\nNow we prove formulas (5); we begin with the second one. Since \\(b_{m+1}=b_{m} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-m-1}{m+1}\\),\n\n\\[\nb_{4 i+2}=b_{4 i} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-1}{4 i+1} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-2}{4 i+2}=b_{4 i} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-1}{4 i+1} \\cdot \\frac{N-2 i-1}{2 i+1} .\n\\]\n\nThe desired congruence \\(b_{4 i+2} \\equiv b_{4 i}+N\\) may be multiplied by the odd number \\((4 i+1)(2 i+1)\\), giving rise to a chain of successively equivalent congruences:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{4 i}(2 N-4 i-1)(N-2 i-1) & \\equiv\\left(b_{4 i}+N\\right)(4 i+1)(2 i+1) & & (\\bmod 2 N) \nb_{4 i}(2 i+1-N) & \\equiv\\left(b_{4 i}+N\\right)(2 i+1) & & (\\bmod 2 N) \n\\left(b_{4 i}+2 i+1\\right) N & \\equiv 0 & & (\\bmod 2 N)\n\n\\]\n\nand the last one is satisfied, as \\(b_{4 i}\\) is odd. This settles the second relation in (5).\nThe first one is proved by induction on \\(i\\). It holds for \\(i=0\\). Assume \\(b_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i}(\\bmod 2 N)\\) and consider \\(i+1\\) :\n\n\\[\nb_{4 i+4}=b_{4 i+2} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-3}{4 i+3} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-4}{4 i+4} ; \\quad a_{2 i+2}=a_{2 i} \\cdot \\frac{N-2 i-1}{2 i+1} \\cdot \\frac{N-2 i-2}{2 i+2} .\n\\]\n\nBoth expressions have the fraction \\(\\frac{N-2 i-2}{2 i+2}\\) as the last factor. Since \\(2 i+2<N=2^{n-1}\\), this fraction reduces to \\(\\ell / m\\) with \\(\\ell\\) and \\(m\\) odd. In showing that \\(b_{4 i+4} \\equiv a_{2 i+2}(\\bmod 2 N)\\), we may ignore this common factor \\(\\ell / m\\). Clearing other odd denominators reduces the claim to\n\n\\[\nb_{4 i+2}(2 N-4 i-3)(2 i+1) \\equiv a_{2 i}(N-2 i-1)(4 i+3) \\quad(\\bmod 2 N)\n\\]\n\nBy the inductive assumption (saying that \\(b_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i}(\\bmod 2 N)\\) ) and by the second relation of (5), this is equivalent to\n\n\\[\n\\left(b_{4 i}+N\\right)(2 i+1) \\equiv b_{4 i}(2 i+1-N) \\quad(\\bmod 2 N)\n\\]\n\na congruence which we have already met in the preceding proof a few lines above. This completes induction (on \\(i\\) ) and the proof of (5), hence also the whole solution.\n\nComment. One can avoid the words congruent modulo in the problem statement by rephrasing the assertion into: Show that these numbers leave distinct remainders in division by \\(2^{n}\\)."}

Since \\(d(f(p))=p\\), the formula just mentioned yields \\(f(p)=q^{p-1}\\) for some prime \\(q\\); in particular \\(f(2)=q^{2-1}=q\\) is a prime. We prove that \\(f(p)=p^{p-1}\\) for all primes \\(p\\).\n\nSuppose that \\(p\\) is odd and \\(f(p)=q^{p-1}\\) for a prime \\(q\\). Applying (ii) first with \\(x=2\\), \\(y=p\\) and then with \\(x=p, y=2\\) shows that \\(f(2 p)\\) divides both \\((2-1) p^{2 p-1} f(2)=p^{2 p-1} f(2)\\) and \\((p-1) 2^{2 p-1} f(p)=(p-1) 2^{2 p-1} q^{p-1}\\). If \\(q \\neq p\\) then the odd prime \\(p\\) does not divide \\((p-1) 2^{2 p-1} q^{p-1}\\), hence the greatest common divisor of \\(p^{2 p-1} f(2)\\) and \\((p-1) 2^{2 p-1} q^{p-1}\\) is a divisor of \\(f(2)\\). Thus \\(f(2 p)\\) divides \\(f(2)\\) which is a prime. As \\(f(2 p)>1\\), we obtain \\(f(2 p)=f(2)\\) which is impossible. So \\(q=p\\), i. e. \\(f(p)=p^{p-1}\\).\n\nFor \\(p=2\\) the same argument with \\(x=2, y=3\\) and \\(x=3, y=2\\) shows that \\(f(6)\\) divides both \\(3^{5} f(2)\\) and \\(2^{6} f(3)=2^{6} 3^{2}\\). If the prime \\(f(2)\\) is odd then \\(f(6)\\) divides \\(3^{2}=9\\), so \\(f(6) \\in\\{1,3,9\\}\\). However then \\(6=d(f(6)) \\in\\{d(1), d(3), d(9)\\}=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) which is false. In conclusion \\(f(2)=2\\).\n\nNext, for each \\(n>1\\) the prime divisors of \\(f(n)\\) are among the ones of \\(n\\). Indeed, let \\(p\\) be the least prime divisor of \\(n\\). Apply (ii) with \\(x=p\\) and \\(y=n / p\\) to obtain that \\(f(n)\\) divides \\((p-1) y^{n-1} f(p)=(p-1) y^{n-1} p^{p-1}\\). Write \\(f(n)=\\ell P\\) where \\(\\ell\\) is coprime to \\(n\\) and \\(P\\) is a product of primes dividing \\(n\\). Since \\(\\ell\\) divides \\((p-1) y^{n-1} p^{p-1}\\) and is coprime to \\(y^{n-1} p^{p-1}\\), it divides \\(p-1\\); hence \\(d(\\ell) \\leq \\ell<p\\). But (i) gives \\(n=d(f(n))=d(\\ell P)\\), and \\(d(\\ell P)=d(\\ell) d(P)\\) as \\(\\ell\\) and \\(P\\) are coprime. Therefore \\(d(\\ell)\\) is a divisor of \\(n\\) less than \\(p\\), meaning that \\(\\ell=1\\) and proving the claim.\n\nNow (1) is immediate for prime powers. If \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(a \\geq 1\\), by the above the only prime factor of \\(f\\left(p^{a}\\right)\\) is \\(p\\) (a prime factor does exist as \\(f\\left(p^{a}\\right)>1\\) ). So \\(f\\left(p^{a}\\right)=p^{b}\\) for some \\(b \\geq 1\\), and (i) yields \\(p^{a}=d\\left(f\\left(p^{a}\\right)\\right)=d\\left(p^{b}\\right)=b+1\\). Hence \\(f\\left(p^{a}\\right)=p^{p^{a}-1}\\), as needed.\n\nLet us finally show that (1) is true for a general \\(n>1\\) with prime factorization \\(n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} \\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}}\\). We saw that the prime factorization of \\(f(n)\\) has the form \\(f(n)=p_{1}^{b_{1}} \\cdots p_{k}^{b_{k}}\\). For \\(i=1, \\ldots, k\\), set \\(x=p_{i}^{a_{i}}\\) and \\(y=n / x\\) in (ii) to infer that \\(f(n)\\) divides \\(\\left(p_{i}^{a_{i}}-1\\right) y^{n-1} f\\left(p_{i}^{a_{i}}\\right)\\). Hence \\(p_{i}^{b_{i}}\\) divides \\(\\left(p_{i}^{a_{i}}-1\\right) y^{n-1} f\\left(p_{i}^{a_{i}}\\right)\\), and because \\(p_{i}^{b_{i}}\\) is coprime to \\(\\left(p_{i}^{a_{i}}-1\\right) y^{n-1}\\), it follows that \\(p_{i}^{b_{i}}\\) divides \\(f\\left(p_{i}^{a_{i}}\\right)=p_{i}^{p_{i}^{a_{i}}-1}\\).

So the estimate \\(n \\leq(p-u) / 2\\) leads to\n\n\\[\np \\geq 2 n+u \\geq 2 n+\\frac{1}{2}(5+\\sqrt{40 n+9})>2 n+\\sqrt{10 n}\n\\]\n\nSince there are infinitely many primes of the form \\(8 k+1\\), it follows easily that there are also infinitely many \\(n\\) with the stated property.\n\nComment. By considering the prime factorization of the product \\(\\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\left(n^{2}+1\\right)\\), it can be obtained that its greatest prime divisor is at least \\(c N \\log N\\). This could improve the statement as \\(p>n \\log n\\).\n\nHowever, the proof applies some advanced information about the distribution of the primes of the form \\(4 k+1\\), which is inappropriate for high schools contests."}
